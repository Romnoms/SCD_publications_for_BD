    "abstract": "Cancer cells display an increased plasticity in their lipid metabolism, which includes the conversion of palmitate to sapienate via the enzyme fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2). We find that FADS2 expression correlates with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) activity across multiple cancer types and is prognostic in some cancer types. Accordingly, activating mTOR signaling by deleting tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) or overexpression of SREBP-1/2 is sufficient to increase FADS2 mRNA expression and sapienate metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and U87 glioblastoma cells, respectively. Conversely, inhibiting mTOR signaling decreases FADS2 expression and sapienate biosynthesis in MEFs with Tsc2 deletion, HUH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and orthotopic HUH7 liver xenografts. In conclusion, we show that mTOR signaling and SREBP activity are sufficient to activate sapienate metabolism by increasing FADS2 expression.

Gemcitabine, a standard treatment for pancreatic cancer, often has poor outcomes for patients as a result of chemoresistance. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets must be identified to overcome gemcitabine resistance. Here, we found that SLC38A5, a glutamine transporter, is more highly overexpressed in gemcitabine-resistant patients than in gemcitabine-sensitive patients. Furthermore, the deletion of SLC38A5 decreased the proliferation and migration of gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cells. We also found that the inhibition of SLC38A5 triggered the ferroptosis signaling pathway via RNA sequencing. Also, silencing SLC38A5 induced mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced glutamine uptake and glutathione (GSH) levels, and downregulated the expressions of GSH-related genes NRF2 and GPX4. The blockade of glutamine uptake negatively modulated the mTOR-SREBP1-SCD1 signaling pathway. Therefore, suppression of SLC38A5 triggers ferroptosis via two pathways that regulate lipid ROS levels. Similarly, we observed that knockdown of SLC38A5 restored gemcitabine sensitivity by hindering tumor growth and metastasis in the orthotopic mouse model. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SLC38A5 could be a novel target to overcome gemcitabine resistance in PDAC therapy.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal ferroptosis has been found to contribute to degenerative brain disorders and traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury, but whether radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI), a critical deleterious effect of cranial radiation therapy for primary and metastatic brain tumors, involves neuronal ferroptosis remains unclear. We have recently discovered that deletion of reprimo (RPRM), a tumor suppressor gene, ameliorates RIBI, in which its protective effect on neurons is one of the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we found that whole brain irradiation (WBI) induced ferroptosis in mouse brain, manifesting as alterations in mitochondrial morphology, iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation and a dramatic reduction in glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) level. Moreover, the hippocampal ferroptosis induced by ionizing irradiation (IR) mainly happened in neurons. Intriguingly, RPRM deletion protected the brain and primary neurons against IR-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, RPRM deletion prevented iron accumulation by reversing the significant increase in the expression of iron storage protein ferritin heavy chain (Fth), ferritin light chain (Ftl) and iron importer transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1), as well as enhancing the expression of iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn) after IR. RPRM deletion also inhibited lipid peroxidation by abolishing the reduction of GPX4 and stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1) induced by IR. Importantly, RPRM deletion restored or even increased the expression of nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2) in irradiated neurons. On top of that, compromised cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) signaling was found to be responsible for the down-regulation of Nrf2 and SCD1 after irradiation, specifically, RPRM bound to CREB and promoted its degradation after IR, leading to a reduction of CREB protein level, which in turn down-regulated Nrf2 and SCD1. Thus, RPRM deletion recovered Nrf2 and SCD1 through its impact on CREB. Taken together, neuronal ferroptosis is involved in RIBI, RPRM deletion prevents IR-induced neuronal ferroptosis through restoring CREB-Nrf2/SCD1 pathways.",

Centers often utilize ECD grafts in patients with low Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores, like patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, few studies have directly examined the outcomes of using ECD grafts in patients with HCC.\nMETHODS: Adults receiving liver transplantation (LT) for HCC between 2010 and 2020 were identified in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database. Recipients were categorized according to donor type: standard criteria donor (SCD), extended criteria donor, donation after brain death (ECD-DBD), and donation after circulatory death (DCD). Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified variables associated with overall or graft survival at 3 years post-LT.\nRESULTS: Most patients received ECD-DBD grafts (51.4%); only 8.3% received DCD grafts. The time on the waitlist was similar for ECD and SCD recipients (P = .79). SCD recipients had higher 5-year overall survival post-LT than ECD-DBD or DCD recipients (79.1%, 77.1%, and 76.8%, respectively, P < .001). Similarly, 5-year graft survival was also highest in SCD recipients (SCD = 77.8%, ECD-DBD = 75.7%, and DCD = 72.2%, P < .001).

While the role of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) in GBM is established, the function of its brain-enriched isoform, SCD5, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that SCD5 is essential for glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) maintenance and genomic stability, with elevated expression in GSCs that declines upon differentiation, underscoring its role in tumor initiation. Through shotgun lipidomics, 13C metabolic flux analysis, and functional genomics, we reveal that SCD1 and SCD5 play non-redundant roles in fatty acid desaturation, with SCD5 preferentially desaturating C18:0 and uniquely contributing to sphingolipid remodeling. Genetic silencing of either isoform disrupts cell cycle progression, impairs DNA damage repair, and reduces GSC viability, while SCD5 knockdown significantly extends survival in orthotopic GBM models. Mechanistically, loss of SCD activity or saturated fatty acid accumulation triggers PARP1 hyperactivation and subsequent degradation, depleting RAD51 to compromise homologous recombination and induce parthanatos. These findings uncover a lipid-mediated vulnerability in GBM, linking fatty acid desaturation to PARP1-dependent genome integrity. Targeting SCD5 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to eliminate therapy-resistant GSCs and enhance the efficacy of genotoxic or immunotherapeutic interventions.",

Yet the molecular mechanisms that determine susceptibility to DNLS-targeted therapies remain unknown, and the lack of brain-penetrant inhibitors of DNLS has prevented their clinical evaluation as GBM therapeutics. Here, we report that YTX-7739, a clinical-stage inhibitor of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD), triggers lipotoxicity in patient-derived GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) and inhibits fatty acid desaturation in GSCs orthotopically implanted in mice.

Here, we review differences in fatty acid metabolism, with a particular focus on the biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) by fatty acid synthase (FASN), elongases, and desaturases. We also describe the significance of individual fatty acids in glioblastoma tumorigenesis, as well as the importance of glycerophospholipid and triacylglycerol synthesis in this process. Specifically, we show the significance and function of various isoforms of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPAT), 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferases (AGPAT), lipins, as well as enzymes involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and cardiolipin (CL). This review also highlights the involvement of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT) in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Due to significant gaps in knowledge, the GEPIA database was utilized to demonstrate the significance of individual enzymes in glioblastoma tumorigenesis. Finally, we also describe the significance of lipid droplets in glioblastoma and the impact of fatty acid synthesis, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on cell membrane fluidity and signal transduction from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).",

However, the predictive value of hippocampal metabolic activity (HMA) for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the independent and incremental predictive value of HMA over myocardial scar for SCD-related events in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and to explore the potential mechanism.\nMETHODS: This prospective study included 270 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction undergoing gated single-photon emission computed tomography and brain/cardiac 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. HMA and myocardial scarring were evaluated. The independent and incremental predictive values of HMA for SCD-related events were explored via the log-rank test, Cox model, C statistic, global χ2 test, and net reclassification improvement. Mediation analysis was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of HMA on SCD-related events by setting left ventricular electrical instability as a mediator.\nRESULTS: Overall, 34 (12.6%; median follow-up, 4.3 years) patients experienced SCD-related events. Functional myocardial scarring and HMA were strongly associated with SCD-related events (all P<0.01). HMA resulted in significant incremental improvements in prognostic value (χ2 increased by 6.598), discrimination (C statistics of 0.760 versus 0.715), and reclassification (net reclassification improvement, 25.6%) for SCD-related events. HMA was associated with SCD-related events via corrected QT interval.\nCONCLUSIONS: Functional myocardial scarring and HMA had strong independent prognostic value in the risk stratification of SCD-related events in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Additionally, HMA had incremental prognostic value based on myocardial scarring. HMA impairment may induce SCD-related events, partly mediated by corrected QT interval.",

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism is associated with colon cancer prognosis and incidence. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which converts fully saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), has been suggested as a vulnerable target for selective elimination of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the clinical significance and physiological role of SCD1 in CSCs has not been well demonstrated. Here, we showed the clinical and biochemical relevance of blocking SCD1 to target CSCs by analyzing human colon cancer data from TCGA and through lipidomic profiling of CSCs with or without SCD1 inhibition using mass spectrometry. Positive associations between SCD1 expression and colorectal cancer patient clinical status and the expression of CSC-related genes (WNT and NOTCH signaling) were found based on TCGA data analysis. Lipidomic profiling of CSCs and bulk cancer cells (BCCs) using mass spectrometry revealed that colon CSCs contained a distinctive lipid profile, with higher free MUFA and lower free SFA levels than in BCCs, suggesting that enhanced SCD1 activity generates MUFAs that may support WNT signaling in CSCs. In addition, all identified phosphatidyl-ethanolamine-containing MUFAs were found at higher levels in CSCs. Interestingly, we observed lower phosphatidyl-serine (18:1/18:0), phosphatidyl-choline (PC; p-18:0/18:1)), and sphingomyelin (SM; d18:1/20:0 or d16:1/22:0) levels in CSCs than in BCCs. Of those, SCD1 inhibition, which efficiently diminished free MUFA levels, increased those specific PC and SM and MUFAs in CSCs promptly. These results suggest that these specific lipid composition is critical for CSC stem cell maintenance. In addition, not only free MUFAs, which are known to be required for WNT signaling, but also other phospholipids, such as SM, which are important for lipid raft formation, may mediate other cell signaling pathways that support CSC maintenance. Comparison of the lipidomic profiles of colon cancer cells with those of previously reported for glioma cells further demonstrated the tissue specific characteristics of lipid metabolism in CSCs.",

    "abstract": "Adult tissues are thought to harbor two populations of \"dormant\" and \"actively dividing\" stem cells. Quiescent stem cells undergo rare asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) through which they self-renew and give rise to tissue-committed \"progenitors\" of distinct fate and \"progenitors\" in turn undergo symmetric cell divisions (SCDs) and clonal expansion. However, quiescent stem cells have not been demonstrated in adult tissues such as skin, testis, liver, and brain. After surgical removal of part of liver and pancreas-adult differentiated cells divide and regenerate and a possible role of stem cells remains doubtful. Long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells are quiescent in nature but ACD has not been convincingly demonstrated even among them. Attempts by various groups to identify a common stemness program that ensures self-renewal among different kinds of stem cells have also remained futile. Uncontrolled self-renewal and compromised differentiation of stem cells possibly initiate leukemia/cancer, but the identity of leukemic stem cells and whether cancer stem cells arise by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in solid tumors are all open-ended questions that need greater clarity. Acceptance of the presence of very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) in adult tissues could clarify several of these existing dilemmas in the field. Data are compiled showing that VSELs undergo ACD in the hematopoietic system, testis, ovary, uterus, and pancreas, whereas tissue-committed progenitors undergo SCD and clonal expansion.

Disturbed cholesterol metabolism is one of the key features of many malignant tumors, including gliomas. This study aimed to investigate the significance of cholesterol metabolism-related genes in prognostic prediction and in guiding individualized treatment of patients with gliomas.\nMETHODS: Transcriptional data and clinicopathological data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Intraoperative glioma samples retained in our unit and the corresponding clinicopathological information were also collected with the patients' knowledge. Firstly, cholesterol metabolism-related gene signatures (CMRGS) were identified and constructed based on difference analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and univariate/multivariate COX analysis. Then, the role of CMRGS in predicting the prognosis of gliomas and distinguishing immune landscapes was evaluated by using nomograms, survival analysis, enrichment analysis, and immune-infiltration analysis. Finally, the drug sensitivity of gliomas in different risk groups was evaluated using the oncoPredict algorithm, and potentially sensitive chemotherapeutic and molecular-targeted drugs were identified.\nRESULTS: The prognostic CMRGS contained seven genes: APOE, SCD, CXCL16, FABP5, S100A11, TNFRSF12A, and ELOVL2. Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the median cholesterol metabolic index (CMI). There were significant differences in clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival between groups. COX analysis suggested that CMRGS was an independent risk factor for glioma prognosis and had a better predictive performance than several classical indicators. In addition, GSEA, immune infiltration analysis showed that CMRGS could differentiate the immune landscapes of patients in groups. The reliability of CMRGS was validated in the CGGA cohort and our Gusu cohort. Finally, 14 drugs sensitive to high-risk patients and 16 drugs sensitive to low-risk patients were identified.\nCONCLUSION: The CMRGS reliably predicts glioma prognosis in multiple cohorts and may be useful in guiding individualized treatment.",

    "abstract": "Immuno-oncological treatment strategies that target abnormal receptor profiles of tumors are an increasingly important feature of cancer therapy. Yet, assessing receptor availability (RA) and drug-target engagement, important determinants of therapeutic efficacy, is challenging with current imaging strategies, largely due to the complex nonspecific uptake behavior of imaging agents in tumors. Herein, we evaluate whether a quantitative noninvasive imaging approach designed to compensate for nonspecific uptake, MRI-coupled paired-agent fluorescence tomography (MRI-PAFT), is capable of rapidly assessing the availability of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in response to one dose of anti-EGFR antibody therapy in orthotopic brain tumor models. Methods: Mice bearing orthotopic brain tumor xenografts with relatively high EGFR expression (U251) (N=10) or undetectable human EGFR (9L) (N=9) were considered in this study. For each tumor type, mice were either treated with one dose of cetuximab, or remained untreated. All animals were scanned using MRI-PAFT, which commenced immediately after paired-agent administration, and values of RA were recovered using a model-based approach, which uses the entire dynamic sequence of agent uptake, as well as a simplified \"snapshot\" approach which requires uptake measurements at only two time points. Recovered values of RA were evaluated between groups and techniques. Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed on tumor specimens from every animal to confirm tumor presence and EGFR status. Results: In animals bearing EGFR(+) tumors, a significant difference in RA values between treated and untreated animals was observed (RA = 0.24 ± 0.15 and 0.61 ± 0.18, respectively, p=0.027), with an area under the curve - receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) value of 0.92. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in RA values between treated and untreated animals bearing EGFR(-) tumors (RA = 0.18 ± 0.19 and 0.27 ± 0.21, respectively; p = 0.89; AUC-ROC = 0.55), nor did we observe a difference between treated EGFR(+) tumors compared to treated and untreated EGFR(-) tumors. Notably, the snapshot paired-agent strategy quantified drug-receptor engagement within just 30 minutes of agent administration. Examination of the targeted agent alone showed no capacity to distinguish tumors either by treatment or receptor status, even 24h after agent administration. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a noninvasive imaging strategy enables rapid quantification of receptor availability in response to therapy, a capability that could be leveraged in preclinical drug development, patient stratification, and treatment monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) are incurable, and new therapies are urgently needed. BCBM upregulates stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, suggesting a potential metabolic vulnerability. Here, we test the effect of a brain-penetrant, clinical-stage SCD inhibitor (SCDi) on breast cancer cells and mouse models of BCBM. We show that SCDi markedly reshapes the lipidome of breast cancer cells, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress, DNA damage, impaired DNA damage repair, and cytotoxicity. Importantly, SCDi alone or combined with a PARP inhibitor prolongs the survival of BCBM-bearing mice. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of SCD enhances antigen presentation by dendritic cells, increases interferon signaling, promotes the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, and decreases the proportion of exhausted T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a syngeneic mouse model of BCBM. Additionally, SCDi reduces the engagement of immunosuppressive pathways, including the PD-1:PD-L1/PD-L2 and PVR/TIGIT axes in the TME. These findings suggest that SCD inhibition could be an effective strategy to both intrinsically reduce tumor growth and reprogram anti-tumor immunity in the brain microenvironment to treat BCBM.",

Increased activity of SCD1 in microglia reduced its response to inflammatory stimuli and promoted the proliferation of cancer cells. Notably, the treatment of tumor-bearing mice with an SCD1 inhibitor combined with an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) significantly reduced brain metastases. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that lung cancer cells activated the STAT3 signaling pathway in microglia leading to increased SCD1 expression.

Amongst all gliomas, those harboring a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation (IDH1mut) acquire a different tumor biology and clinical manifestation from those that are IDH1WT. Understanding the unique metabolic profile reprogrammed by IDH1 mutation has the potential to identify new molecular targets for glioma therapy. Herein, we uncover increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and their phospholipids in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), generated by IDH1 mutation, that are responsible for Golgi and ER dilation. We demonstrate a direct link between the IDH1 mutation and this organelle morphology via D-2HG-induced stearyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) overexpression, the rate-limiting enzyme in MUFA biosynthesis. Inhibition of IDH1 mutation or SCD silencing restores ER and Golgi morphology, while D-2HG and oleic acid induces morphological defects in these organelles. Moreover, addition of oleic acid, which tilts the balance towards elevated levels of MUFA, produces IDH1mut-specific cellular apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that IDH1mut-induced SCD overexpression can rearrange the distribution of lipids in the organelles of glioma cells, providing new insight into the link between lipid metabolism and organelle morphology in these cells, with potential and unique therapeutic implications.",

Here, we demonstrate that bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibition induces an adaptive response leading to MCL1 protein-driven evasion of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Consequently, co-targeting MCL1 and BET is highly synergistic in breast cancer models. The mechanism of adaptive response to BET inhibition involves the upregulation of lipid synthesis enzymes including the rate-limiting stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase. Changes in lipid synthesis pathway are associated with increases in cell motility and membrane fluidity as well as re-localization and activation of HER2/EGFR. In turn, the HER2/EGFR signaling results in the accumulation of and vulnerability to the inhibition of MCL1. Drug response and genomics analyses reveal that MCL1 copy-number alterations are associated with effective BET and MCL1 co-targeting. The high frequency of MCL1 chromosomal amplifications (>30%) in basal-like breast cancers suggests that BET and MCL1 co-targeting may have therapeutic utility in this aggressive subtype of breast cancer.",

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are screened between invasive NFPA samples and normal pituitary gland samples, followed by pathway and ontology (GO) enrichment analyses. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and analyzed for these DEGs, and module analysis was performed.

Cholesterol is a major component of myelin, and glia-produced cholesterol serves as a glial growth factor in synaptogenesis. We have recently demonstrated that antipsychotic drugs activate the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors in human and rat glial cells, with subsequent up-regulation of numerous downstream genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Since this stimulation of cellular lipogenesis could represent a new mechanism of action of psychotropic drugs, we investigated whether antidepressants and mood-stabilizers were able to induce a similar activation of SREBP-controlled lipid biosynthesis. Cultured human glioma cells (GaMg) were exposed to the antidepressant drugs imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine, citalopram, fluoxetine, mirtazapine and bupropion and the mood-stabilizers/antiepileptics lithium, valproate and carbamazepine. All antidepressant drugs activated the SREBP system with subsequent up-regulation of the downstream lipogenesis-related genes, although to a markedly different extent. The mood-stabilizers did not affect the SREBPs or the downstream genes. These results link antidepressant drugs, but not mood-stabilizers, to SREBP-mediated activation of cellular lipogenesis, and demonstrate a functional similarity between antipsychotic and antidepressant molecular drug action.",

Two Mabs, C12 and D12, which localized specifically to tumors in athymic mouse-human glioma xenograft paired label localization assays, are IgG3 antibodies; both bind readily to staphylococcal protein A in column purification and radioimmunoprecipitation procedures. Both iodinate via the chloramine-T method yielding 125I-immunoreactive product by direct cell surface radioimmunoassay and absorption assay. By indirect cell surface radioimmunoassay, a cultured cell line panel consisting of 17 gliomas, 3 medulloblastomas, 2 neuroblastomas, 2 melanomas, and 2 fetal and 2 adult brain-derived cell lines was examined; the two Mabs were highly similar but distinct in their reactivity profiles. Each was positive with greater than 47% of the gliomas tested (C12, 9 of 17; D12, 8 of 17); and with 1 of 3 medulloblastomas, 1 of 2 melanomas, and cell lines derived from 12- and 16-week-gestation human fetal brain. No reactivity was observed with neuroblastoma or adult brain-derived cell lines or with neutral glycolipids and gangliosides extracted from D-54 MG xenografts or human glioma cell lines. Notable extraneuroectodermal reactivity included that of Mab D12 for splenic trabeculae and the spermatids and Sertoli cells in the testes. Following immunoprecipitation of [3H]leucine labeled cell membrane preparations, Mabs C12 and D12 have consistently yielded unique bands in the Mr 180,000 and Mr 88,000 regions respectively. When used in paired label localization experiments in s.c. D-54 MG xenograft-bearing athymic mice, Mabs C12 and D12 demonstrate similar localization patterns, attaining peak localization indices at day 3 (D12) or 4 (C12); the maximum percentage of injected Mab bound to tumor ranged from 5% (D12) to 8% (C12). The peak tumor/normal brain localization ratios (167-181) attained by these Mabs at days 1-2 followed by their rapid clearance suggest that these Mabs are potentially useful imaging and therapeutic agents for further investigation.",

Metabolic targeting has long been advocated as a therapy against many tumors including GBM, but how lipid metabolism is altered to suit different microenvironmental conditions and whether cancer stem cells (CSCs) have altered lipid metabolism are outstanding questions in the field. We interrogated gene expression in separate microenvironments of GBM organoid models that mimic the transition between nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor pseudopalisading/perinecrotic tumor zones using spatial-capture RNA-sequencing. We revealed a striking difference in lipid processing gene expression and total lipid content between diverse cell populations from the same patient, with lipid enrichment in hypoxic organoid cores and also in perinecrotic and pseudopalisading regions of primary patient tumors. This was accompanied by regionally restricted upregulation of hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) gene expression in organoid cores and pseudopalisading regions of clinical GBM specimens, but not lower-grade brain tumors. CSCs have low lipid droplet accumulation compared to non-CSCs in organoid models and xenograft tumors, and prospectively sorted lipid-low GBM cells are functionally enriched for stem cell activity. Targeted lipidomic analysis of multiple patient-derived models revealed a significant shift in lipid metabolism between GBM CSCs and non-CSCs, suggesting that lipid levels may not be simply a product of the microenvironment but also may be a reflection of cellular state. CSCs had decreased levels of major classes of neutral lipids compared to non-CSCs, but had significantly increased polyunsaturated fatty acid production due to high fatty acid desaturase (FADS1/2) expression which was essential to maintain CSC viability and self-renewal. Our data demonstrate spatially and hierarchically distinct lipid metabolism phenotypes occur clinically in the majority of patients, can be recapitulated in laboratory models, and may represent therapeutic targets for GBM.",

New and more effective therapeutic approaches are being sought based on studies of the various mechanisms of GBM tumorigenesis, including the synthesis and metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA), an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). PubMed, GEPIA, and the transcriptomics analysis carried out by Seifert et al. were used in writing this paper. In this paper, we discuss in detail the biosynthesis of this acid in GBM tumors, with a special focus on certain enzymes: fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1, FADS2, and elongation of long-chain fatty acids family member 5 (ELOVL5). We also discuss ARA metabolism, particularly its release from cell membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (cPLA2, iPLA2, and sPLA2) and its processing by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), lipoxygenases (5-LOX, 12-LOX, 15-LOX-1, and 15-LOX-2), and cytochrome P450. Next, we discuss the significance of lipid mediators synthesized from ARA in GBM cancer processes, including prostaglandins (PGE2, PGD2, and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2)), thromboxane A2 (TxA2), oxo-eicosatetraenoic acids, leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), lipoxins, and many others.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant tumor with a high recurrence rate and has very poor prognosis in humans. The median survival is still <2 years. Therefore, a new treatment strategy should be established. Recently, this cancer has been thought to be heterogeneous, consisting of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are self-renewable, multipotent, and treatment resistant. So various strategies targeting glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) have been investigated. This study focused on strategies targeting GSCs through the induction of differentiation using bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). The expression of CD133, a cancer stem cell marker, under BMP4 treatment in GSCs was examined using flow cytometry, western blotting, and quantitative PCR. Immunofluorescent staining of GSCs was also performed to examine the type of cell division: asymmetric cell division (ACD) or symmetric cell division (SCD). We obtained the following results. The BMP4 treatment caused downregulation of CD133 expression. Moreover, it induced ACD in GSCs. While the ACD ratio was 23% without BMP4 treatment, it was 38% with BMP4 treatment (P=0.004). Furthermore, the tumor sphere assay demonstrated that BMP4 suppresses self-renewal ability. In conclusion, these findings may provide a new perspective on how BMP4 treatment reduces the tumorigenicity of GSCs.",

By using Fat-1 mice which convert n-6 to n-3 PUFAs in the brain, this study further evaluated anti-depressant mechanisms of n-3 PUFAs in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model. Adult male Fat-1 and wild-type (WT) mice were fed soybean oil diet for 8 weeks. Depression-like behaviors were measured 24 h after saline or LPS central administration. In WT littermates, LPS reduced sucrose intake, but increased immobility in forced-swimming and tail suspension tests. Microglial M1 phenotype CD11b expression and concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-17 were elevated, while M2 phenotype-related IL-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were decreased. LPS also reduced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B (Trk B), while increasing glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and pro-BDNF, p75, NO, and iNOS levels. In Fat-1 mice, LPS-induced behavioral changes were attenuated, which were associated with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and reversed changes in p75, NO, iNOS, and BDNF. Gas chromatography assay confirmed increased n-3 PUFA levels and n-3/n-6 ratios in the brains of Fat-1 mice.

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death caused by the iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids and is related to cell metabolism, redox homeostasis and various signalling pathways related to cancer. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) KB-1460A1.5 acts as a tumour suppressor gene to regulate tumour growth in gliomas, but its molecular network regulatory mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we found that KB-1460A1.5 can induce ferroptosis in glioma and enhance sensitivity to RSL3, a ferroptosis inducer. Tandem mass tag proteomics and nontargeted metabolomics suggest that KB-1460A1.5 affects polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolic processes. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based medium- and long-chain fatty acid-targeted metabolomics confirmed that upregulation of KB-1460A1.5 decreased the levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid (OA) and palmitoleic acid (PO) in glioma cells. The addition of OA and PO restored KB-1460A1.5-induced cellular ferroptosis. Molecularly, KB-1460A1.5 inhibited the mammalian target of rapamycin signalling pathway to suppress the expression of downstream sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), thereby attenuating the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1)-mediated desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Finally, an animal model of subcutaneous glioma confirmed that KB-1460A1.5 could inhibit tumour progression, SREBP-1/SCD1 expression and ferroptosis. In conclusion, increasing the expression level of KB-1460A1.5 in glioma can promote the induction of oxidative stress and ferroptosis in cancer cells through SREBP-1/SCD1-mediated adipogenesis, demonstrating therapeutic potential in preclinical models.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The ability to noninvasively quantify receptor availability (RA) in solid tumors is an aspirational goal of molecular imaging, often challenged by the influence of non-specific accumulation of the contrast agent. Paired-agent imaging (PAI) techniques aim to compensate for this effect by imaging the kinetics of a targeted agent and an untargeted isotype, often simultaneously, and comparing the kinetics of the two agents to estimate RA. This is usually accomplished using two spectrally distinct fluorescent agents, limiting the technique to superficial tissues and/or preclinical applications. Applying the approach in humans using conventional imaging modalities is generally infeasible since most modalities are unable to routinely image multiple agents simultaneously. We examine the ability of PAI to be implemented in a cross-modality paradigm, in which the targeted and untargeted agent kinetics are imaged with different modalities and used to recover receptor availability.\nPROCEDURES: Eighteen mice bearing orthotopic brain tumors were administered a solution containing three contrast agents: (1) a fluorescent agent targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), (2) an untargeted fluorescent isotype, and (3) a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) for MRI imaging. The kinetics of all three agents were imaged for 1 h after administration using an MRI-coupled fluorescence tomography system. Paired-agent receptor availability was computed using (1) the conventional all-optical approach using the targeted and untargeted optical agent images and (2) the cross-modality approach using the targeted optical and untargeted MRI-GBCA images. Receptor availability estimates between the two methods were compared.\nRESULTS: Receptor availability values using the cross-modality approach were highly correlated to the conventional, single-modality approach (r = 0.94; p < 0.00001).\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that cross-modality paired-agent imaging for quantifying receptor availability is feasible.

    "abstract": "A hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the formation of multiple focal demyelinating lesions within the central nervous system (CNS). These lesions mainly consist of phagocytes that play a key role in lesion progression and remyelination, and therefore represent a promising therapeutic target in MS. We recently showed that unsaturated fatty acids produced by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 induce inflammatory foam cell formation during demyelination. These fatty acids are elongated by the \"elongation of very long chain fatty acids\" proteins (ELOVLs), generating a series of functionally distinct lipids. Here, we show that the expression and activity of ELOVLs are altered in myelin-induced foam cells. Especially ELOVL6, an enzyme responsible for converting saturated and monounsaturated C16 fatty acids into C18 species, was found to be up-regulated in myelin phagocytosing phagocytes in vitro and in MS lesions. Depletion of Elovl6 induced a repair-promoting phagocyte phenotype through activation of the S1P/PPARγ pathway. Elovl6-deficient foamy macrophages showed enhanced ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux, increased production of neurotrophic factors, and reduced expression of inflammatory mediators. Moreover, our data show that ELOVL6 hampers CNS repair, as Elovl6 deficiency prevented demyelination and boosted remyelination in organotypic brain slice cultures and the mouse cuprizone model. These findings indicate that targeting ELOVL6 activity may be an effective strategy to stimulate CNS repair in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater-Bay-Area of South China has an 86 million population and faces a significant challenge of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the characteristics and prevalence of AD in this area are still unclear due to the rarely available community-based neuroimaging AD cohort.\nMETHODS: Following the standard protocols of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Greater-Bay-Area Healthy Aging Brain Study (GHABS) was initiated in 2021. GHABS participants completed clinical assessments, plasma biomarkers, genotyping, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), β-amyloid (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and tau PET imaging. The GHABS cohort focuses on pathophysiology characterization and early AD detection in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. In this study, we analyzed plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 (A), p-Tau181 (T), neurofilament light, and GFAP by Simoa in 470 Chinese older adults, and 301, 195, and 70 had MRI, Aβ PET, and tau PET, respectively. Plasma biomarkers, Aβ PET, tau PET, hippocampal volume, and temporal-metaROI cortical thickness were compared between normal control (NC), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia groups, controlling for age, sex, and APOE-ε4. The prevalence of plasma A/T profiles and Aβ PET positivity were also determined in different diagnostic groups.\nRESULTS: The aims, study design, data collection, and potential applications of GHABS are summarized. SCD individuals had significantly higher plasma p-Tau181 and plasma GFAP than the NC individuals. MCI and dementia patients showed more abnormal changes in all the plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers than NC and SCD individuals. The frequencies of plasma A+/T+ (NC; 5.9%, SCD: 8.2%, MCI: 25.3%, dementia: 64.9%) and Aβ PET positivity (NC: 25.6%, SCD: 22.5%, MCI: 47.7%, dementia: 89.3%) were reported.\nDISCUSSION: The GHABS cohort may provide helpful guidance toward designing standard AD community cohorts in South China. This study, for the first time, reported the pathophysiology characterization of plasma biomarkers, Aβ PET, tau PET, hippocampal atrophy, and AD-signature cortical thinning, as well as the prevalence of Aβ PET positivity in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the characteristics of abnormal AD pathological changes in South China's older population.",

In this study, we explored the diagnostic performance of structural imaging and DKI of the hippocampus in the AD spectrum. Eleven SCD, thirty-seven MCI, sixteen AD, and nineteen age- and sex-matched normal controls (NCs) were included. Bilateral hippocampal volume, mean diffusivity (MD), and mean kurtosis (MK) were obtained. We detected that in AD vs. NCs, the right hippocampal volume showed the most prominent AUC value (AUC = 0.977); in MCI vs. NCs, the right hippocampal MD was the most sensitive discriminator (AUC = 0.819); in SCD vs. NCs, the left hippocampal MK was the most sensitive biomarker (AUC = 0.775). These findings suggest that, in the predementia stage (SCD and MCI), hippocampal microstructural changes are predominant, and the best discriminators are microstructural measurements (left hippocampal MK for SCD and right hippocampal MD for MCI); while in the dementia stage (AD), hippocampal macrostructural alterations are superior, and the best indicator is the macrostructural index (right hippocampal volume).",

To evaluate individual differences in cognitive trajectories based on loneliness, subgroup analysis was performed in 51 patients with AD (n = 23) and pre-dementia status (SCD-MCI, n = 28) using the longitudinal scores of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive component-Japanese version (ADAS-Jcog). Whole brain VBM analysis comparing lonely to non-lonely patients revealed loneliness was associated with decreased rGMV in bilateral thalamus in SCD patients and in the left middle occipital gyrus and the cerebellar vermal lobules I - V in MCI patients. Annual change of ADAS-Jcog in patients who reported loneliness was significantly greater comparing to these non-lonely in SCD-MCI group, but not in AD group. Our results indicate that perceived social isolation, or loneliness, might be a comorbid symptom of patients with SCD or MCI, which makes them more vulnerable to the neuropathology of future AD progression.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Impaired perivascular clearance has been suggested as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, it remains unresolved when the anatomy of the perivascular space (PVS) is altered during AD progression. Therefore, this study investigates the association between PVS volume and AD progression in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, both with and without subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and in those clinically diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A convolutional neural network was trained using manually corrected, filter-based segmentations (n = 1000) to automatically segment the PVS in the centrum semiovale from interpolated, coronal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans (n = 894). These scans were sourced from the national German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study. Convolutional neural network-based segmentations and those performed by a human rater were compared in terms of segmentation volume, identified PVS clusters, as well as Dice score. The comparison revealed good segmentation quality (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.70 with P < 0.0001 for PVS volume, detection rate in cluster analysis = 84.3%, and Dice score = 59.0%). Subsequent multivariate linear regression analysis, adjusted for participants' age, was performed to correlate PVS volume with clinical diagnoses, disease progression, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, lifestyle factors, and cognitive function. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Comprehensive Neuropsychological Test Battery, and the Cognitive Subscale of the 13-Item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale.\nRESULTS: Multivariate analysis, adjusted for age, revealed that participants with AD and MCI, but not those with SCD, had significantly higher PVS volumes compared with CU participants without SCD ( P = 0.001 for each group). Furthermore, CU participants who developed incident MCI within 4.5 years after the baseline assessment showed significantly higher PVS volumes at baseline compared with those who did not progress to MCI ( P = 0.03). Cognitive function was negatively correlated with PVS volume across all participant groups ( P ≤ 0.005 for each). No significant correlation was found between PVS volume and any of the following parameters: cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, sleep quality, body mass index, nicotine consumption, or alcohol abuse.\nCONCLUSIONS: The very early changes of PVS volume may suggest that alterations in PVS function are involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Overall, the volumetric assessment of centrum semiovale PVS represents a very early imaging biomarker for AD.",

Multivariable linear regression was conducted to investigate the relationship between hs-CRP concentration and brain structural alterations, and cognitive function, respectively.\nRESULTS: Hs-CRP was positively associated with gray matter volume in the left fusiform (β = 0.16, pFDR = 0.023) and the left parahippocampal gyrus (β = 0.16, pFDR = 0.029). Post hoc analysis revealed that these associations were mainly driven by patients with MCI and AD. The interaction of diagnosis and CRP was significantly associated with annual cognitive changes (β = 0.43, p = 0.008). Among these patients with AD, lower baseline CRP was correlated with greater future cognitive decline (r = -0.41, p = 0.013).\nCONCLUSION: Our study suggests that increased hs-CRP level may exert protective effect on brain structure alterations and future cognitive changes among patients already with cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes observed during aging is a prerequisite to design strategies to prevent age-related diseases. Aging is associated with metabolic changes, including alteration in the brain lipid metabolism. These alterations may contribute to the development of pathophysiological conditions. Modifications in the gut microbiota composition are also observed during aging. As communication axes exist between the gut microbiota and the brain and knowing that microbiota influences the host metabolism, we speculated on whether age-associated modifications in the gut microbiota could be involved in the lipid changes observed in aging brain. For that purpose, germ-free mice were colonized by the fecal microbiota of young or old donor mice. Lipid classes and fatty acid profiles were determined in the brain (cortex), plasma and liver by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel-coated quartz rods and gas chromatography. Gut colonization by microbiota of old mice resulted in a significant increase in total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and a significant decrease in the relative amounts of cholesterol and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the cortex. Among the eight most represented fatty acids in the cortex, the relative abundances of five (C18:1n-9, C22:6n-3, C20:4n-6, C18:1n-7, and C20:1n-9) were significantly altered in mice inoculated with an aged microbiota. Liquid chromatography analyses revealed that the relative abundance of major species among phosphatidyl and plasmenylcholine (PC 16:0/18:1), phosphatidyl and plasmenylethanolamine (PE 18:0/22:6), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE 22:6) and sphingomyelins (SM d18:1/18:0) were significantly altered in the cortex of mice colonized by the microbiota obtained from aged donors. Transplantation of microbiota from old mice also modified the lipid class and fatty acid content in the liver. Finally, we found that the expression of several genes involved in MUFA and PUFA synthesis (Scd1, Fads1, Fads2, Elovl2, and Elovl5) was dysregulated in mice inoculated with an aged microbiota. In conclusion, our data suggest that changes in gut microbiota that are associated with aging can impact brain and liver lipid metabolisms. Lipid changes induced by an aged microbiota recapitulate some features of aging, thus pointing out the potential role of microbiota alterations in the age-related degradation of the health status.",

Their gut microbiota, bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), tight junction (TJ) protein, and inflammatory cytokines in blood were measured before surgery and on postsurgical day 1, 3, and 7 (or before discharge).\nRESULTS: The short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were lower while the gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide and TJ were higher preoperatively in both the SCD and aMCI (pAD) groups compared with the NC group. After surgery, a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria, and an increase in both gram-negative bacteria and plasma claudin were significant in the pAD groups relative to the NC group. SCFA-producing bacteria were negatively correlated with TJ and cytokines in pAD patients on postsurgical day 7.

This study aimed to survey the role of ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 2 (ORMDL2) in fatty acid metabolism of glioma cells. The expression of ORMDL2 in glioma and its association with survival rate was detected using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and Kaplan-Meier survival curve. The effect of ORMDL2 on glioma was explored by culturing human glioma cells in vitro and constructing mouse glioma models. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and fatty acid metabolism were detected by CCK-8, flow cytometry, colony formation assay, BODIPY staining, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR. ORMDL2 was upregulated in lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues as compared to brain tissues collected from patients with traumatic craniotomy. Its high expression was associated with poor patient survival. ORMDL2 silencing inhibited glioma cell proliferation, lipid droplet formation, and promoted apoptosis in vitro. Silencing of ORMDL2 in xenograft mouse model inhibited tumor volume and weight. Additionally, ORMDL2 silencing decreased the levels of fatty acid metabolism-related factors FASN, ACC1 and SCD1, and the phosphorylation of a downstream effector of mTORC1 (S6K). Moreover, mTORC1 agonist MHY1485 reversed the inhibitory effect of ORMDL2 silencing on U87 cell fatty acid metabolism; mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin reversed the promoting effect of ORMDL2 overexpression on U251 cell fatty acid metabolism.

    "abstract": "1-O-Acylceramides (1-OACs) have a fatty acid esterified to the 1-hydroxyl of the sphingosine head group of the ceramide, and recently we identified these lipids as natural components of human and mouse epidermis. Here we show epidermal 1-OACs arise shortly before birth during the establishment of the water permeability barrier in mice. Fractionation of human epidermis indicates 1-OACs concentrate in the stratum corneum. During in vitro maturation into reconstructed human epidermis, human keratinocytes dramatically increase 1-OAC levels indicating they are one source of epidermal 1-OACs. In search of potential enzymes responsible for 1-OAC synthesis in vivo, we analyzed mutant mice with deficiencies of ceramide synthases (Cers2, Cers3, or Cers4), diacylglycerol acyltransferases (Dgat1 or Dgat2), elongase of very long fatty acids 3 (Elovl3), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (Lcat), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1), or acidic ceramidase (Asah1). Overall levels of 1-OACs did not decrease in any mouse model. In Cers3 and Dgat2-deficient epidermis they even increased in correlation with deficient skin barrier function. Dagt2 deficiency reshapes 1-OAC synthesis with an increase in 1-OACs with N-linked non-hydroxylated fatty acids and a 60% decrease compared to control in levels of 1-OACs with N-linked hydroxylated palmitate. As none of the single enzyme deficiencies we examined resulted in a lack of 1-OACs, we conclude that either there is functional redundancy in forming 1-OAC and more than one enzyme is involved, and/or an unknown acyltransferase of the epidermis performs the final step of 1-OAC synthesis, the implications of which are discussed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer creates an immunosuppressive environment that hampers immune responses, allowing tumors to grow and resist therapy. One way the immune system fights back is by inducing ferroptosis, a type of cell death, in tumor cells through CD8 + T cells. This involves lipid peroxidation and enzymes like lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3), which makes cells more prone to ferroptosis. However, the mechanisms by which cancer cells avoid immunotherapy-mediated ferroptosis are unclear. Our study reveals how cancer cells evade ferroptosis and anti-tumor immunity through the upregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 7 (Fabp7).\nMETHODS: To explore how cancer cells resist immune cell-mediated ferroptosis, we used a comprehensive range of techniques. We worked with cell lines including PD1-sensitive, PD1-resistant, B16F10, and QPP7 glioblastoma cells, and conducted in vivo studies in syngeneic 129 Sv/Ev, C57BL/6, and conditional knockout mice with Rora deletion specifically in CD8+ T cells, Cd8 cre;Rorafl mice. Methods included mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, targeted lipidomics, Oil Red O staining, Seahorse analysis, quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, PPARγ transcription factor assays, ChIP-seq, untargeted lipidomic analysis, ROS assay, ex vivo co-culture of CD8+ T cells with cancer cells, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation assay, flow cytometry and Imaging Mass Cytometry.\nRESULTS: PD1-resistant tumors upregulate Fabp7, driving protective metabolic changes that shield cells from ferroptosis and evade anti-tumor immunity. Fabp7 decreases the transcription of ferroptosis-inducing genes like Lpcat3 and increases the transcription of ferroptosis-protective genes such as Bmal1 through epigenetic reprogramming. Lipidomic profiling revealed that Fabp7 increases triglycerides and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which impede lipid peroxidation and ROS generation. Fabp7 also improves mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), enhancing cancer cell survival. Furthermore, cancer cells increase Fabp7 expression in CD8+ T cells, disrupting circadian clock gene expression and triggering apoptosis through p53 stabilization. Clinical trial data revealed that higher FABP7 expression correlates with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival in patients undergoing immunotherapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which cancer cells evade immune-mediated ferroptosis through Fabp7 upregulation. This protein reprograms lipid metabolism and disrupts circadian regulation in immune cells, promoting tumor survival and resistance to immunotherapy. Targeting Fabp7 could enhance immunotherapy effectiveness by re-sensitizing resistant tumors to ferroptosis.",

The role of proteasomes in PA- or oxidative stress-induced podocyte injury and pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is unknown. We investigated the effects of PA on expression of 20S and 26S proteasomes, proteasome activator 28 (PA28) regulators, and the immunoproteasome in cultured podocytes and renal cortical tissues of db/db and db/m mice using Western blot analysis. Glomerular areas and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) widths of db/db and db/m mice were examined using morphometry. Short-term incubation of PA or low levels of H2O2 upregulated only the immunoproteasome in cultured podocytes. Long-term exposure of podocytes to PA ultimately downregulated the immunoproteasome as with other proteasomes, whereas oleic acid (OA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) restored the PA-induced decreased protein levels. In db/db mice, renal cortical immunoproteasome expression with PA28α was significantly decreased compared with db/m mice, and glomerular areas and GBM widths were significantly increased compared with db/m mice. Feeding of an OA-rich olive oil or EPA-rich fish oil protected db/db mice against the reduced renal cortical immunoproteasome expression, glomerular enlargement, and GBM thickening. These results demonstrate that lipotoxicity downregulates the immunoproteasome in podocytes and kidneys in type 2 diabetes and that OA and EPA protected type 2 diabetic mice against decreased renal cortical immunoproteasome expression and the progression of DN.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest brain tumor with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the first-line chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of GBM; however, it suffers from several limitations, including short half-life, rapid metabolism, <1% brain bioavailability, methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) based chemoresistance, and hematological toxicities. Several approaches have been adopted to overcome these limitations, particularly by using nanotechnology-based systems, but its physicochemical properties make TMZ challenging to load into these nanocarriers. In the current research, we conjugated TMZ with different fatty acids, i.e., linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA), and palmitic acid (PA), to obtain TMZ-fatty acid conjugates, which are comparatively hydrophobic, less prone to degradation and potent. These conjugates were thoroughly characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The synthesized conjugates, namely Temozolomide-oleic acid (TOA,6R1), Temozolomide-linoleic acid (TLA, 6R2), and Temozolomide-palmitic acid (TPA, 6R3), showed an IC50 of 101.4, 67.97, and 672.04 μM, respectively in C6 cells and 428.257, 366.43 and 413.69 μM, respectively in U87-MG cells. On the other hand, the free TMZ showed an IC50 of >1000 μM and 564.23 μM in C6 and U87-MG, respectively. Further, the in vivo efficacy of the TMZ-fatty acid conjugates was evaluated in the C6-induced orthotropic rat glioblastoma model, wherein the TMZ-fatty acid conjugate showed improved survival rate (1.6 folds) and overall health of the animals. Collectively, the conjugation of fatty acids with TMZ improves its anticancer potential against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).",

Yet, little is known about the heterogeneity of metabolic activity of cancer cells due to the lack of tools to directly probe it. Here, we present a novel method, 13C-SpaceM for spatial single-cell isotope tracing of glucose-dependent de novo lipogenesis. The method combines imaging mass spectrometry for spatially-resolved detection of 13C6-glucose-derived 13C label incorporated into esterified fatty acids with microscopy and computational methods for data integration and analysis. We validated 13C-SpaceM on a spatially-heterogeneous normoxia-hypoxia model of liver cancer cells. Investigating cultured cells, we revealed single-cell heterogeneity of lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool labelling degree upon ACLY knockdown that is hidden in the bulk analysis and its effect on synthesis of individual fatty acids. Next, we adapted 13C-SpaceM to analyze tissue sections of mice harboring isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas. We found a strong induction of de novo fatty acid synthesis in the tumor tissue compared to the surrounding brain. Comparison of fatty acid isotopologue patterns revealed elevated uptake of mono-unsaturated and essential fatty acids in the tumor. Furthermore, our analysis uncovered substantial spatial heterogeneity in the labelling of the lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool indicative of metabolic reprogramming during microenvironmental adaptation. Overall, 13C-SpaceM enables novel ways for spatial probing of metabolic activity at the single cell level.

    "abstract": "The expression level of TRPV1 is high in hippocampus which is a main epileptic area in the brain. In addition to the actions of capsaicin (CAP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), the TRPV1 channel is activated in neurons by endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide (AEA). In the current study, we investigated the role of inhibitors of TRPV1 (capsazepine, CPZ), AEA transport (AM404), and FAAH (URB597) on the modulation of Ca2+ entry, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in in vitro seizure-induced rat hippocampus and human glioblastoma (DBTRG) cell line. The seizure was induced in the hippocampal and DBTRG neurons using in vitro 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to trigger a seizure-like activity model. CPZ and AM404 were fully effective in reversing 4-AP-induced intracellular free Ca2+ concentration of the hippocampus and TRPV1 current density of DBTRG. However, AEA and CAP did not activate TRPV1 in the URB597-treated neurons. Hence, we observed TRPV1 blocker effects of URB597 in the DBTRG neurons. In addition, the AM404 and CPZ treatments decreased intracellular ROS production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis, caspases 3 and 9 values in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the results indicate that inhibition of AEA transport, FAAH synthesis, and TRPV1 activity can result in remarkable neuroprotective effects in the epileptic neurons. Possible molecular pathways of involvement of capsazepine (CPZ) and AM4040 in anandamide and capsaicin (CAP)-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and Ca2+ accumulation through TRPV1 channel in the seizure-induced rat hippocampus and human glioblastoma neurons. The TRPV1 channel is activated by different stimuli including reactive oxygen species (ROS), anandamide (AEA), and CAP and it is blocked by capsazepine (CPZ). Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is also activated by AEA. The AEA levels in cytosol are decreased by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme. Inhibition of FAAH through URB597 induces stimulation of CB1 receptor through accumulation AEA. URB597 acts antiepileptic effects through inhibition of TRPV1. Overloaded Ca2+ concentration of mitochondria can induce an apoptotic program by stimulating the release of apoptosis-promoting factors such as caspases 3 and caspase 9 by generating ROS due to respiratory chain damage.

It responds poorly to standard therapies, such as surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Many chemotherapeutic drugs are focused on apoptosis induction and radiation sensitivity. Inhibition of histone acetylation via histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) is one such strategy. Statins (or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) are classical drugs used to lower cholesterol but also inhibitors of histone deacetylation activity. This study analyzes the combinatory effects of valproic acid (VPA) and fluvastatin on apoptosis induction in GBM8401 cells. The results show that they act synergistically in inducing γ-H2AX and apoptosis accompanied by higher acetylated histones H3 and H4. Downregulation of p53 occurred by VPA alone and fluvastatin alone, but not at their combined application; upregulation of p21 at the protein level was induced by each of the drugs alone and no further increase occurred at combined application. The drug BEZ235 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and attenuated the level of γ-H2AX as well as cleaved PARP (cPARP) induced at combined application of VPA and fluvastatin. Induction of apoptosis within a 48h incubation period was massive when measured as the subG1 peak (97%) and was detected after a 24h incubation at low level when assayed with PE Annexin V. Synergistic apoptosis induction was demonstrated also after 24h incubation by the appearance of cPARP. Partial silencing of p21 reduced cPARP as well as the percentage of apoptotic cells in the subG1 peak. However, partial silencing of p53 had no effect on apoptosis.

Glioblastoma is classified as the stage-four progression of a glioma tumor, and its diagnosis results in a shortened life expectancy. Treatment options for GBM include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, surgical intervention, and conventional pharmacotherapy; however, at best, they extend the patient's life by a maximum of 5 years. GBMs are considered incurable due to their high recurrence rate, despite various aggressive therapeutic approaches which can have many serious adverse effects. Ceramides, classified as endocannabinoids, offer a promising novel therapeutic approach for GBM. Endocannabinoids may enhance the apoptosis of GBM cells but have no effect on normal healthy neural cells. Cannabinoids promote atypical protein kinase C, deactivate fatty acid amide hydrolase enzymes, and activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and TRPV2 to induce pro-apoptotic signaling pathways without increasing endogenous cannabinoids. In previous in vivo studies, endocannabinoids, chemically classified as amide formations of oleic and palmitic acids, have been shown to increase the pro-apoptotic activity of human cancer cells and inhibit cell migration and angiogenesis.

Previously, we demonstrated that FABP7 requires its binding partner to exert its function and that a mutation in the FA-binding site of FABP7 affects tumour biology. Here, we explored the role of FA ligand binding for FABP7 function in tumour proliferation and examined the mechanism of FABP7 and ligand interaction in tumour biology. We discovered that among several FA treatment, oleic acid (OA) boosted cell proliferation of FABP7-expressing cells. In turn, OA increased FABP7 nuclear localization, and the accumulation of FABP7-OA complex in the nucleus induced the formation of nuclear lipid droplet (nLD), as well as an increase in colocalization of nLD with promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies. Furthermore, OA increased mRNA levels of proliferation-related genes in FABP7-expressing cells through histone acetylation. Interestingly, these OA-boosted functions were abrogated in FABP7-knockout cells and mutant FABP7-overexpressing cells. Thus, our findings suggest that FABP7-OA intracellular interaction may modulate nLD formation and the epigenetic status thereby enhancing transcription of proliferation-regulating genes, ultimately driving tumour cell proliferation.",

However, all of these studies have examined anandamide accumulation at long time points when downstream effects such as metabolism and intracellular sequestration are operative. In the current study, we have investigated the initial rates (<1 min) of anandamide accumulation in neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells in culture and have determined that uptake is not saturable with increasing concentrations of anandamide. However, anandamide hydrolysis, after uptake in neuroblastoma cells, was saturable at steady-state time points (5 min), suggesting that fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) may be responsible for observed saturation of uptake at long time points. In general, arvanil, olvanil, and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)arachidonylamide (AM404) have been characterized as transport inhibitors in studies using long incubations. However, we found these \"transport inhibitors\" did not inhibit anandamide uptake in neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells at short time points (40 sec or less). Furthermore, we confirmed that these inhibitors in vitro were actually inhibitors of FAAH. Therefore, the likely mechanism by which the transport inhibitors raise anandamide levels to exert pharmacological effects is by inhibiting FAAH, and they should be reevaluated in this context. Immunofluorescence has indicated that FAAH staining resides mainly on intracellular membranes of neuroblastoma cells, and this finding is consistent with our observed kinetics of anandamide hydrolysis. In summary, these data suggest that anandamide uptake is a process of simple diffusion.

The effectiveness of traditional therapies for GBM is limited and therefore new therapies are highly desired. Previous studies show that lipid metabolism reprogramming may be a potential therapeutic target in GBM. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of free fatty acid-induced lipotoxicity for the suppression of glioma growth. U87 glioma cells are treated with three fatty acids (FAs): palmitic acid (PA), oleic acid (OA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Uptake of the FAs and formation of lipid droplets (LDs) are imaged and quantified using a lab-built stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope. Our results show that a supply of 200 µM PA, OA, and EPA leads to efficient LDs accumulation in glioma cells. We find that inhibition of triglycerides (TAGs) synthesis depletes LDs and enhances lipotoxicity, which is evidenced by the reduced cell proliferation rates. In particular, our results suggest that EPA treatment combined with depletion of LDs significantly reduces the survival rate of glioma cells by more than 50%, indicating the therapeutic potential of this approach. Future work will focus on understanding the metabolic mechanism of EPA-induced lipotoxicity to further enhance its anticancer effects.",

Two PAP activities distinguished by their differential sensitivity to Mg2+ and Triton X-100 were identified in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. A digitonin permeabilization method was employed to study the basal distribution of the cytosolic PAP and its redistribution upon cell exposure to amphiphilic lipids. Under conditions which release 100% of the cytosolic marker enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, only 60% of total cellular PAP activity was released into the medium through the digitonin-induced membrane pores, suggesting that about 40% of the total are membrane associated. Elevated plasma-membrane levels of phosphatidic acid, accomplished by incubating cells with Streptomyces chromofuscus phospholipase D, did not affect the distribution of cytosolic PAP. In contrast, oleic acid induced a marked concentration-dependent redistribution of the cytosolic enzyme to the particulate fraction. PAP redistribution was completely abolished in the presence of the sphingoid base sphingosine, previously shown to inhibit PAP activity in vitro (Lavie, Y., Piterman, O. & Liscovitch, M. (1990) FEBS Lett. 277, 7-10). Thus, the distribution of cytosolic PAP is reciprocally regulated by a long-chain (fatty) acid and a long-chain (sphingoid) base which are breakdown products of phospholipids and sphingolipids, respectively. These effects might influence PAP function in glycerolipid metabolism and signal transduction under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",

Antiproliferative mechanisms related to ODA remain unknown. In this work, we evaluated the effects of ODA on cell viability and morphological changes in a rat RG2 glioblastoma cell line and compared these effects with primary astrocyte cultures from 8-day postnatal rats.

Changes in RG2 cell viability and morphology induced by ODA were assessed by viability/mitochondrial activity test and phase contrast microscopy, respectively. The ratios of necrotic and apoptotic cell death, and cell cycle alterations, were evaluated by flow cytometry. The roles of CB1 and CB2 receptors on ODA-induced changes were explored with specific receptor antagonists. ODA (100 μM) induced somatic damage, detachment of somatic bodies, cytoplasmic polarization, and somatic shrinkage in RG2 cells at 24 and 48 h. In contrast, primary astrocytes treated at the same ODA concentrations exhibited cell aggregation but not cell damage. ODA (100 μM) increased apoptotic cell death and cell arrest in the G1 phase at 24 h in the RG2 line. The effects induced by ODA on cell viability of RG2 cells were independent of CB1 and CB2 receptors or changes in intracellular calcium transient. Results of this novel study suggest that ODA exerts specific antiproliferative effects on RG2 glioblastoma cells through unconventional apoptotic mechanisms not involving canonical signals.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase-B/mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signalling pathway is crucial for cell survival, differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism. Xihuang pills (XHP) are a traditional Chinese preparation with antitumour properties. They inhibit the growth of breast cancer, glioma, and other tumours by regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. However, the effects and mechanisms of action of XHP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway effectively inhibits the progression of HCC. However, no study has focused on the XHP-associated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Therefore, we hypothesized that XHP might play a role in inhibiting HCC through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway.\nAIM: To confirm the effect of XHP on HCC and the possible mechanisms involved.\nMETHODS: The chemical constituents and active components of XHP were analysed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Cell-based experiments and in vivo xenograft tumour experiments were utilized to evaluate the effect of XHP on HCC tumorigenesis. First, SMMC-7721 cells were incubated with different concentrations of XHP (0, 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/mL) for 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay, followed by an assessment of cell migration using a wound healing assay. Second, the effect of XHP on the apoptosis of SMMC-7721 cells was evaluated. SMMC-7721 cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate and annexin V/propidium iodide. The number of apoptotic cells and cell cycle distribution were measured using flow cytometry. The cleaved protein and mRNA expression levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were detected using Western blotting and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), respectively. Third, Western blotting and RT-qPCR were performed to confirm the effects of XHP on the protein and mRNA expression of components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Finally, the effects of XHP on the tumorigenesis of subcutaneous hepatocellular tumours in nude mice were assessed.\nRESULTS: The following 12 compounds were identified in XHP using high-resolution mass spectrometry: Valine, 4-gingerol, myrrhone, ricinoleic acid, glycocholic acid, curzerenone, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid, oleic acid, germacrone, 3-acetyl-9,11-dehydro-β-boswellic acid, 5β-androstane-3,17-dione, and 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid. The cell viability assay results showed that treatment with 0.625 mg/mL XHP extract decreased HCC cell viability after 12 h, and the effects were dose- and time-dependent. The results of the cell scratch assay showed that the migration of HCC cells was significantly inhibited in a time-dependent manner by the administration of XHP extract (0.625 mg/mL). Moreover, XHP significantly inhibited cell migration and resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, XHP downregulated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, which activated apoptosis executioner proteins (e.g., caspase-9 and caspase-3). The inhibitory effects of XHP on HCC cell growth were determined in vivo by analysing the tumour xenograft volumes and weights.\nCONCLUSION: XHP inhibited HCC cell growth and migration by stimulating apoptosis via the downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, followed by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Our findings clarified that the antitumour effects of XHP on HCC cells are mediated by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, revealing that XHP may be a potential complementary therapy for HCC.",

Only palmitoylethanolamide produced any effect in the absence of AEA. The ability of palmitoylethanolamide to potentiate the response to AEA was retained when the N-CH(2)CH(2)OH group was replaced by N-CH(2)CH(2)Cl,whereas replacement with N-alkyl substituents [from -H up to -(CH(2))(12)CH(3)] resulted either in a reduction or in a complete loss of this activity. The tertiary amide N-(CH(2)CH(3))(2) (19) and N-morpholino (20) analogues of palmitoylethanolamide potentiated the response to 1 microM AEA to a greater degree than the parent compound, whereas the N-(CH(3))(2) analogue was inactive. 19 and 20 produced leftward shifts in the dose-response curve for AEA activation of Ca(2+) influx into hVR1-HEK293 cells. EC(50) values for AEA to produce Ca(2+) influx into hVR1-HEK293 cells were 1.1, 1.1, 0.54 and 0.36 microM in the presence of 0, 1, 3 and 10 microM 19, respectively. The corresponding values for 20 were 1.5, 1.3, 0.77 and 0.17 microM, respectively. The compounds did not affect the dose-response curves to capsaicin. The ability of oleoylethanolamide to potentiate AEA is retained by the N-CH(2)CH(3) and N-CH(CH(3))(2) analogues (22 and 23, respectively). 22 and 23 produced a small ( approximately 25%) inhibition of the binding of [(3)H]-CP55,940 and [(3)H]-WIN 55,212-2 to CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, respectively, expressed in CHO cells. The compounds inhibited the metabolism of 2 microM [(3)H]-AEA by rat brain fatty acid amidohydrolase with IC(50) values of 5.6 and 11 microM, respectively. In contrast, 19 and 20 were without effect on either binding to CB receptors or fatty acid amidohydrolase activity. Minor reductions in the accumulation of 10 microM [(3)H]-AEA into C6 glioma cells were seen at 10 microM concentrations of 19 and 20.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autophagy consists on the delivery of cytoplasmic material and organelles to lysosomes for degradation. Research on autophagy is a growing field because deciphering the basic mechanisms of autophagy is key to understanding its role in health and disease, and to paving the way to discovering novel therapeutic strategies. Studies with chemotherapeutic drugs and pharmacological tools support a role for dihydroceramides as mediators of autophagy. However, their effect on the autophagy outcome (cell survival or death) is more controversial.\nMETHODS: We have examined the capacity of structurally varied Des1 inhibitors to stimulate autophagy (LC3-II analysis), to increase dihydroceramides (mass spectrometry) and to reduce cell viability (SRB) in T98G and U87MG glioblastoma cells under different experimental conditions.\nRESULTS: The compounds activity on autophagy induction took place concomitantly with accumulation of dihydroceramides, which occurred by both stimulation of ceramide synthesis de novo and reduction of Des1 activity. However, autophagy was also induced by the test compounds after preincubation with myriocin and in cells with a reduced capacity to produce dihydroceramides (U87DND). Autophagy inhibition with 3-methyladenine in the de novo dihydroceramide synthesis competent U87MG cells increased cytotoxicity, while genetic inhibition of autophagy in U87DND cells, poorly efficient at synthesizing dihydroceramides, augmented resistance to the test compounds.\nCONCLUSION: Dihydroceramide desaturase 1 inhibitors activate autophagy via both dihydroceramide-dependent and independent pathways and the balance between the two pathways influences the final cell fate.\nGENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The cells capacity to biosynthesize dihydroceramides must be taken into account in proautophagic Des1 inhibitors-including therapies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic stress, an important factor in the development of depressive disorders, leads to an increased formation of cortisol, which causes a hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In addition, cortisol mediates an adaptive effect on plasma membrane fluidity which may affect signal transduction of membrane-bound receptors and contribute to pathophysiological changes.\nMETHODS: Membrane fluidity was measured by fluorescence anisotropy using DPH (1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene) and TMA-DPH (1-(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene). Changes in cellular content of phosphatidylcholine species was determined by pulse-chase experiments using deuterated choline and mass spectrometry. Single molecule tracking was used to examine the lateral mobility of β1-adrenoceptors and changes in cAMP formation were measured by ELISA.\nRESULTS: Chronic exposure (6 - 8 days) of C6 cells to cortisol dose-dependently decreased DPH and TMA-DPH fluorescence anisotropy, reflecting increased membrane fluidity. In contrast, cells pretreated with St. John's wort extract Ze117 showed increased DPH and TMA-DPH fluorescence anisotropy values, indicating a membrane rigidification effect which was mediated at least by the constituents hypericin, hyperforin, quercetin, amentoflavone and biapigenin. The observed membrane fluidizing effect of cortisol could be reversed by cotreatment with Ze117. The membrane rigidification of Ze117 was in line with the in parallel observed decrease in the phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine ratio determined in whole cell lipid extracts. Interestingly, pulse-chase experiments demonstrated, that Ze117 inhibited the incorporation of choline-D9 in phosphatidylcholine species with saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids compared to control cells, while the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine species with polyunsaturated fatty acids was not affected. C6 cells whose membranes have become more rigid by Ze117 showed altered lateral mobility of β1-adrenoceptors as well as reduced cAMP formation after stimulation with the β1-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine.\nCONCLUSION: Obviously, the signaling of β1-adrenoceptors depends on the nature of the membrane environment. It can therefore be assumed that Ze117 has a normalizing effect not only on the membrane fluidity of \"stressed\" cells, but also on lateral mobility and subsequently on the signal transduction of membrane-associated receptors.",

    "abstract": "The effects of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) upon rat C6 glioma cell proliferation were examined and compared with a series of synthetic cannabinoids and related compounds. Cells were treated with the compounds each day and cell proliferation was monitored for up to 5 days of exposure. AEA time- and concentration-dependently inhibited C6 cell proliferation. After 4 days of treatment, AEA and 2-AG inhibited C6 cell proliferation with similar potencies (IC(50) values of 1.6 and 1.8 microM, respectively), whereas palmitoylethanolamide showed no significant antiproliferative effects at concentrations up to 10 microM. The antiproliferative effects of both AEA and 2-AG were blocked completely by a combination of antagonists at cannabinoid receptors (SR141716A and SR144528 or AM251 and AM630) and vanilloid receptors (capsazepine) as well as by alpha-tocopherol (0.1 and 10 microM), and reduced by calpeptin (10 microM) and fumonisin B(1) (10 microM), but not by L-cycloserine (1 and 100 microM).

It is concluded that the antiproliferative effects of the endocannabinoids upon C6 cells are brought about by a mechanism involving combined activation of both vanilloid receptors and to a lesser extent cannabinoid receptors, and leading to oxidative stress and calpain activation.

    "abstract": "Therapeutic efficacy of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is often severely limited by poor penetration of therapeutics through blood-brain barrier (BBB) into brain tissues and lack of tumor targeting. In this regard, a functionalized upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)-based delivery system which can target brain tumor and convert deep tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light into visible light for precise phototherapies on brain tumor was developed in this work. Methods: The UCNP-based phototherapy delivery system was acquired by assembly of oleic acid-coated UCNPs with angiopep-2/cholesterol-conjugated poly(ethylene glycol) and the hydrophobic photosensitizers. The hybrid nanoparticles (ANG-IMNPs) were characterized by DLS, TEM, UV/vis and fluorescence spectrophotometer. Cellular uptake was examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The PDT/PTT effect of ANG-IMNPs was evaluated using MTT assay. Tumor accumulation of NPs was determined by a non-invasive in vivo imaging system (IVIS). The in vivo anti-glioma effect of ANG-IMNPs was evaluated by immunohistochemical (IHC) examination of tumor tissues and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: In vitro data demonstrated enhanced uptake of ANG-IMNPs by murine astrocytoma cells (ALTS1C1) and pronounced cytotoxicity by combined NIR-triggered PDT and PTT. In consistence with the increased penetration of ANG-IMNPs through endothelial monolayer in vitro, the NPs have also shown significantly enhanced accumulation at brain tumor by IVIS. The IHC tissue examination confirmed prominent apoptotic and necrotic effects on tumor cells in mice receiving targeted dual photo-based therapies, which also led to enhanced median survival (24 days) as compared to the NP treatment without angiopep-2 (14 days). Conclusion: In vitro and in vivo data strongly indicate that the ANG-IMNPs were capable of selectively delivering dual photosensitizers to brain astrocytoma tumors for effective PDT/PTT in conjugation with a substantially improved median survival. The therapeutic efficacy of ANG-IMNPs demonstrated in this study suggests their potential in overcoming BBB and establishing an effective treatment against GBM.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of action of 2-hydroxyoleic acid (2OHOA), a potent antitumor compound, has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we show that human cancer cells have markedly lower levels of sphingomyelin (SM) than nontumor (MRC-5) cells. In this context, 2OHOA treatment strongly augments SM mass (4.6-fold), restoring the levels found in MRC-5 cells, while a loss of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine is observed (57 and 30%, respectively). The increased SM mass was due to a rapid and highly specific activation of SM synthases (SMS). This effect appeared to be specific against cancer cells as it did not affect nontumor MRC-5 cells. Therefore, low SM levels are associated with the tumorigenic transformation that produces cancer cells. SM accumulation occurred at the plasma membrane and caused an increase in membrane global order and lipid raft packing in model membranes. These modifications would account for the observed alteration by 2OHOA in the localization of proteins involved in cell apoptosis (Fas receptor) or differentiation (Ras). Importantly, SMS inhibition by D609 diminished 2OHOA effect on cell cycle. Therefore, we propose that the regulation of SMS activity in tumor cells is a critical upstream event in 2OHOA antitumor mechanism, which also explains its specificity for cancer cells, its potency, and the lack of undesired side effects. Finally, the specific activation of SMS explains the ability of this compound to trigger cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, and autophagy or apoptosis in cancer cells.",

Even though ION may induce different toxic effects in a wide variety of cell types and animal systems, there is a notable lack of toxicological data on the human nervous system, particularly important given the increasing number of applications on this specific system. An important mechanism of nanotoxicity is reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress.

To this aim, ability of ION to generate ROS (both in the absence and presence of cells) was determined, and consequences of oxidative potential were assessed (i) on DNA by means of the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1)-modified comet assay, and (ii) on antioxidant reserves by analyzing ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Conditions tested included a range of concentrations, two exposure times (3 and 24 h), and absence and presence of serum in the cell culture media. Results confirmed that, even though ION were not able to produce ROS in acellular environments, ROS formation was increased in the neuronal and glial cells by ION exposure, and was parallel to induction of oxidative DNA damage and, only in the case of neuronal cells treated with S-ION, to decreases in the GSH/GSSG ratio. Present findings suggest the production of oxidative stress as a potential action mechanism leading to the previously reported cellular effects, and indicate that ION may pose a health risk to human nervous system cells by generating oxidative stress, and thus should be used with caution.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells play a pivotal role in brain fatty acid metabolism and membrane biogenesis. However, the potential regulation of lipogenesis and cholesterologenesis by fatty acids in glial cells has been barely investigated. Here, we show that physiologically relevant concentrations of various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly reduce [1-(14)C]acetate incorporation into fatty acids and cholesterol in C6 cells. Oleic acid was the most effective at depressing lipogenesis and cholesterologenesis; a decreased label incorporation into cellular palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids was detected, suggesting that an enzymatic step(s) of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was affected. To clarify this issue, the activities of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and FAS were determined with an in situ digitonin-permeabilized cell assay after incubation of C6 cells with fatty acids. ACC activity was strongly reduced ( approximately 80%) by oleic acid, whereas no significant change in FAS activity was observed. Oleic acid also reduced the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). The inhibition of ACC and HMGCR activities is corroborated by the decreases in ACC and HMGCR mRNA abundance and protein levels. The downregulation of ACC and HMGCR activities and expression by oleic acid could contribute to the reduced lipogenesis and cholesterologenesis.",

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) represent a new class of anti-neoplastic drugs. In the current study, we have characterized the mechanism by which glioblastoma cells evade the effect of PARPi as anti-tumor agents. We have found that suppression of PARP activity exerts an anti-stemness effect and has a dual impact on autophagy, inducing its activation in the first 24 h (together with down-regulation of the pro-survival mTOR pathway) and preventing autophagosomes fusion to lysosomes at later time-points, in primary glioma cells. In parallel, PARPi triggered the synthesis of lipid droplets (LDs) through ACC-dependent activation of de novo fatty acids (FA) synthesis. Notably, inhibiting β-oxidation and blocking FA utilization, increased PARPi-induced glioma cell death while treatment with oleic acid (OA) prevented the anti-glioma effect of PARPi. Moreover, LDs fuel glioma cells by inducing pro-survival lipid consumption as confirmed by quantitation of oxygen consumption rates using Seahorse respirometry in presence or absence of OA. In summary, we uncover a novel mechanism by which glioblastoma escapes to anti-tumor agents through metabolic reprogramming, inducing the synthesis and utilization of LDs as a pro-survival strategy in response to PARP inhibition.",

Four neural-derived cell lines (C6 rat glioma; N1E-115 mouse and SK-N-MC and SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma) express different protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and differentially respond to 4beta-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (beta-TPA)-stimulation of PtdCho synthesis. We examined involvement of PLD and PKC in the hydrolysis and resynthesis of PtdCho and phosphatidylethanolamine stimulated by beta-TPA, bryostatin (a non-phorbol PKC activator) and oleic acid (18:1n-9) in the four cell lines. beta-TPA or bryostatin produced similar enhancement of [3H]Cho incorporation, loss of stimulated synthesis after down regulation of PKC, and activation of PLD. In C6 cells, staurosporine (STS) and bis-indolylmaleimide (BIM) only partially inhibited basal and beta-TPA-stimulated PLD activity measured as choline or ethanolamine release; phosphatidylbutanol formation after prelabeling with [9,10-3H]18:1n-9, [9,10-3H]myristic acid (14:0), [1-14C]eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) or 1-O-[alkyl-1', 2-3H]-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine gave similar results. STS at >200 nM activated PLD in the presence or absence of beta-TPA. In SK-N-SH cells where PtdCho synthesis was stimulated by beta-TPA or bryostatin, no effect of these agents on PLD was observed. 18:1n-9 stimulated PtdCho synthesis and, to a lesser extent, hydrolysis by PLD both with and without beta-TPA present. Fatty acids had no effect on PKC activities and down regulation of PKC with beta-TPA enhanced fatty acid stimulation of PtdCho synthesis. Thus, activation of PLD hydrolysis preceding resynthesis is involved in the stimulatory effects of beta-TPA on PtdCho synthesis in some but not all of these neural derived cells. Further, PLD hydrolysis of PtdCho and PtdEtn appear to have differing aspects of regulation. Fatty acid regulation of PtdCho synthesis occurs independent of PKC activation. Accordingly, regulation of membrane phospholipid degradation and resynthesis in association with lipid second messenger generation can involve a complex interplay of PLD, PKC, and fatty acids.

PPARδ is a nuclear receptor and transcription factor that induces myelination, promotes oligodendroglial and neuronal differentiation, and possess anti-neuroinflammatory properties. While both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic effects have been described for PPARδ, we propose that PPARδ may perform a predominantly anticancer role in tumors originating from the neuroectoderm. PPARδ ligand-activation via oleic acid and GW501516, or overexpression of PPARδ, elicits profound antitumor actions in neuroblastoma and melanoma. In glioblastomas, there is evidence indicating a differentiation failure of O2A (oligodendroglial-astrocytic biprogenitor) cells and it has been shown that EA reduced DNA synthesis in C6 rat glioblastoma spheroid cultures in clinically achievable concentrations.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The tumor-derived GL261 cell line is used as a model for studying glioblastoma and other high-grade gliomas, and can be cultured adherently or as free-floating aggregates known as neurospheres. These different culture conditions give rise to distinct phenotypes, with increased tumorigenicity displayed by neurosphere-cultured cells. An important technique for understanding GL261 pathobiology is live cell fluorescent imaging of intracellular calcium. However, live cell imaging of GL261 neurospheres presents a technical challenge, as experimental manipulations where drugs are added to the extracellular media cause the cells to move during analysis. Here we present a method to immobilize GL261 neurospheres with low melting point agarose for calcium imaging using the fluorescent calcium sensor fura-2.\nMETHODS: GL261 cells were obtained from the NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Tumor Repository and cultured as adherent cells or induced to form neurospheres by placing freshly trypsinized cells into serum-free media containing fibroblast growth factor 2, epidermal growth factor, and B-27 supplement. Prior to experiments, adherent cells were loaded with fura-2 and cultured on 8-well chamber slides. Non-adherent neurospheres were first loaded with fura-2, placed in droplets onto an 8-well chamber slide, and finally covered with a thin layer of low melting point agarose to immobilize the cells. Ratiometric pseudocolored images were obtained during treatment with ATP, capsaicin, or vehicle control. Cells were marked as responsive if fluorescence levels increased more than 30% above baseline. Differences between treatment groups were tested using Student's t-tests and one-way ANOVA.\nRESULTS: We found that cellular responses to pharmacological treatments differ based on cellular phenotype. Adherent cells and neurospheres both responded to ATP with a rise in intracellular calcium. Notably, capsaicin treatment led to robust responses in GL261 neurospheres but not adherent cells.\nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the use of low melting point agarose for immobilizing GL261 cells, a method that is broadly applicable to any cell type cultured in suspension, including acutely trypsinized cells and primary tumor cells. Our results indicate that it is important to consider GL261 phenotype (adherent or neurosphere) when interpreting data regarding physiological responses to experimental compounds.",

Thapsigargin caused only a transient increase of [Ca2+]i (< 1 min) in N1E-115 cells similar in magnitude and duration to agonist-induced calcium release mediated by inositol trisphosphate. Sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i due to influx of extracellular calcium, as occurs in most other cell lines including C6 cells, did not occur in N1E-115 cells. Increased uptake of inorganic phosphate (Pi) associated calcium influx was observed in C6 but not in N1E-115 cells. Thapsigargin affected phospholipid synthesis in both cell lines, most likely by inhibiting phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase as indicated by diversion of [3H]oleic acid incorporation from triacylglycerol to phospholipid synthesis and stimulation of [32P]Pi incorporation into anionic phospholipids at the expense of phosphatidylcholine synthesis. The response to increased phosphatidate/phosphatidyl-CMP availability was cell specific. Thapsigargin (> 100 nM) selectively stimulated phosphatidylglycerol synthesis 20-30-fold in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells while phosphatidylinositol synthesis was increased < 2-fold. In contrast, phosphatidylglycerol was not affected in C6 glioma cells and phosphatidylinositol synthesis was stimulated 8-fold by thapsigargin (> 1 microM). Agonist-stimulated calcium release did not increase phosphatidylglycerol synthesis in N1E-115 cells. Thapsigargin-stimulated phosphatidylglycerol synthesis and agonist-stimulated phosphatidylinositol synthesis could occur at the same time. Similar results were obtained with TMB-8, an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ release that decreases diacylglycerol utilization by blocking choline uptake and phosphatidylcholine synthesis without affecting resting [Ca2+]i. Thus [Ca2+]i does not directly mediate the effects of thapsigargin, TMB-8 or agonist stimulation on anionic phospholipid metabolism. These additional effects may limit the use of thapsigargin to assess Ca(2+)-dependence of phospholipid metabolism associated with Ca(2+)-mediated signal transduction.",

Administration of a-GBM (9.5 mg) caused albuminuria, decreased creatinine clearance, increased numbers of intra-glomerular neutrophils and increased excretion of TXB2, 2,3-dinor-TXB2 (products of TXA2) and 6-oxo-PGF 1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-PGF 1 alpha (products of PGI2) at 24 h. 3. Interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta; 5 micrograms) alone caused an increase in PGI2 metabolite excretion but had no effect on TXA2 metabolites. It had no effect on creatinine clearance but increased numbers of glomerular neutrophils by approximately 4-5 fold compared to a-GBM. 4. Pretreatment of rats with IL-1 beta before a-GBM synergistically increased albumin excretion but only additively increased eicosanoid excretion. Numbers of intra-glomerular neutrophils and creatinine clearance were unchanged compared to IL-1 beta alone. 5. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (10 mgkg-1 i.p., twice daily for 4 days) inhibited both serum TXB2 production and urinary prostaglandin excretion.

We conclude that the 50% inhibition of thromboxane production induced by ibuprofen does not modify the fall in creatinine clearance of accumulation of neutrophils in the glomerulus caused by the a-GBM.

    "abstract": "A variety of anti-cancer drugs elevate endogenous ceramide, thereby inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Recently, we have introduced novel ceramide analogs of the beta-hydroxy alkyl amide type, which trigger pro-apoptotic signaling pathways without prior elevation of endogenous ceramide. They induce apoptosis specifically in rapidly dividing neuroblastoma cells, but not in resting or differentiated cells. We characterize new ceramide mimics that have been derived from N-acylation of serinol (S), diethanolamine (B), propanolamine (P), and tris(hydroxy-methyl)methylamine (T) with myristic (14), palmitic (16), or oleic (18) acid. The water solubility of these compounds exceeds that of ceramide by more than 100-fold (up to 5 mM). Apoptosis of human neuroblastoma, glioma, medulloblastoma, and adenocarcinoma cells is induced by N-(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)-palmitoylamide, C16-serinol (S16), N-(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)-oleoylamide, C18-serinol (S18), N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-myristoyl-amide (B16), and N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-oleoylamide (T18) within 60 min of incubation, and is completed even after removal of the compound from the medium. This is most likely due to a rapid uptake of the analogs followed by their slow release from the cells. Alteration of the acyl chain length to less than 14 methylene units, removal of the amino group, or reducing the number of hydroxyalkyl residues to less than two significantly lowers or eliminates the pro-apoptotic potential of these compounds. The target specificity of novel ceramide analogs for tumor cells, their water solubility, and fast pro-apoptotic mechanism indicates a high therapeutic potential for cancer treatment.",

Phospholipids were preferentially labelled with the radioactive fatty acids, and only a little radioactivity was found in the neutral lipid fraction, mainly in diacylglycerols. Each fatty acid precursor label was incorporated in individual phospholipids to a proportion which reflected the typical acyl group composition of glycerophospholipids; we observed high levels of incorporation of palmitic acid and its derivatives into choline glycerophospholipids, and high levels of incorporation of linolenic acid and its derivatives into ethanolamine glycerophospholipids. This pattern was more marked in tumor cells than in normal cells, and the differentiation of tumor cells partially restored the normal pattern, mainly in bromodeoxyuridine-treated NN cells.

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a key element in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative diseases and sees the involvement of different neuronal and non-neuronal cells as players able to respond to inflammatory signals of immune origin. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous potent anti-inflammatory agent, in which activity is regulated by N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), that hydrolyzes saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid ethanolamides, such as PEA. In this research, an in vitro study was performed on different neuronal (SH-SY5Y) and non-neuronal cell lines (C6, BV-2, and Mo3.13) subjected to NAAA enzyme silencing and treated with PEA ultra-micronized (PEA-um) (1, 3, and 10 μM) to increase the amount of endogenous PEA available for counteract neuroinflammation provoked by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 μg/mL) and interferon gamma (INF-γ )(100 U/mL). Cell viability was performed by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) staining, suggesting a protective effect of PEA-um (3 and 10 μM) on all cell lines studied. Western Blot analysis for inflammatory markers (Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)) was carried out in control and NAAA-silenced cells, highlighting how the concomitant treatment of the neuronal and non-neuronal cells with PEA-um after NAAA genic downregulation is satisfactory to counteract neuroinflammation. These in vitro findings support the protective role of endogenous PEA availability in the neuronal field, bringing interesting information for a translational point of view.",

Compared to the current reference drug for this condition, temozolomide (TMZ), 2OHOA combated glioma more efficiently and, unlike TMZ, tumor relapse was not observed following 2OHOA treatment.

Parallel to membrane-lipid regulation, treatment with 2OHOA induced a dramatic translocation of Ras from the membrane to the cytoplasm, which inhibited the MAP kinase pathway, reduced activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and downregulated Cyclin D-CDK4/6 proteins followed by hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB). These regulatory effects were associated with induction of glioma cell differentiation into mature glial cells followed by autophagic cell death.

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Although transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) is critical for normal and leukemic differentiation, its role in cell and metabolic homeostasis is largely unknown in cancer. Here, multiomics analyses uncovered a coordinated activation of C/EBPα and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that increased lipid anabolism in vivo and in patients with FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mechanistically, C/EBPα regulated the fatty acid synthase (FASN)-stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) axis to promote fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and desaturation. We further demonstrated that FLT3 or C/EBPα inactivation decreased monounsaturated FA incorporation to membrane phospholipids through SCD downregulation. Consequently, SCD inhibition enhanced susceptibility to lipid redox stress that was exploited by combining FLT3 and glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibition to trigger lipid oxidative stress, enhancing ferroptotic death of FLT3-mutant AML cells. Altogether, our study reveals a C/EBPα function in lipid homeostasis and adaptation to redox stress, and a previously unreported vulnerability of FLT3-mutant AML to ferroptosis with promising therapeutic application.\nSIGNIFICANCE: FLT3 mutations are found in 30% of AML cases and are actionable by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here, we discovered that C/EBPα regulates FA biosynthesis and protection from lipid redox stress downstream mutant-FLT3 signaling, which confers a vulnerability to ferroptosis upon FLT3 inhibition with therapeutic potential in AML.

    "abstract": "PROBLEM: Tumor recurrence is a major clinical issue that represents the principal cause of cancer-related deaths, with few targetable common pathways. Mechanisms by which residual tumors persist and progress under a continuous shift between hypoxia-reoxygenation after neoadjuvent-therapy are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of lipid metabolism and tumor redox balance in tumor recurrence.\nMETHODS: Lipidomics, proteomics and mass spectrometry imaging approaches where applied to mouse tumor models of recurrence. Genetic and pharmacological inhibitions of lipid mediators in tumors were used in vivo and in functional assays in vitro.\nRESULTS: We found that stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) expressed by cancer cells and fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4) produced by tumor endothelial cells (TECs) and adipocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are essential for tumor relapse in response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and chemotherapy. SCD1 and FABP4 were also found upregulated in recurrent human breast cancer samples and correlated with worse prognosis of cancer patients with different types of tumors. Mechanistically, SCD1 leads to fatty acid (FA) desaturation and FABP4 derived from TEM enhances lipid droplet (LD) in cancer cells, which cooperatively protect from oxidative stress-induced ferroptosis. We revealed that lipid mobilization and desaturation elicit tumor intrinsic antioxidant and anti-ferroptotic resources for survival and regrowth in a harsh TME. Inhibition of lipid transport from TME by FABP4 inhibitor reduced tumor regrowth and by genetic - or by pharmacological - targeting SCD1 in vivo, tumor regrowth was abolished completely.\nCONCLUSION: This finding unveils that it is worth taking advantage of tumor lipid addiction, as a tumor vulnerability to design novel treatment strategy to prevent cancer recurrence.",

Metabolic reprogramming is considered a key mechanism for cancer cell growth and proliferation. However, how metabolic changes contribute to the progression of metaplasia to dysplasia remains unclear. We have examined metabolic dynamics during gastric carcinogenesis using a novel mouse model that induces Kras activation in zymogen-secreting chief cells.\nMETHODS: We generated a Gif-rtTA;TetO-Cre;KrasG12D (GCK) mouse model that continuously induces active Kras expression in chief cells after doxycycline treatment. Histologic examination and imaging mass spectrometry were performed in the GCK mouse stomachs at 2 to 14 weeks after doxycycline treatment. Mouse and human gastric organoids were used for metabolic enzyme inhibitor treatment. The GCK mice were treated with a stearoyl- coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) inhibitor to inhibit the fatty acid desaturation. Tissue microarrays were used to assess the SCD expression in human gastrointestinal cancers.\nRESULTS: The GCK mice developed metaplasia and high-grade dysplasia within 4 months. Metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis to fatty acid metabolism occurred during metaplasia progression to dysplasia. Altered fatty acid desaturation through SCD produces a novel eicosenoic acid, which fuels dysplastic cell hyperproliferation and survival. The SCD inhibitor killed both mouse and human dysplastic organoids and selectively targeted dysplastic cells in vivo. SCD was up-regulated during carcinogenesis in human gastrointestinal cancers.\nCONCLUSIONS: Active Kras expression only in gastric chief cells drives the full spectrum of gastric carcinogenesis. Also, oncogenic metabolic rewiring is an essential adaptation for high-energy demand in dysplastic cells.",

The EZH2 inhibitor EPZ-6438 was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020. However, its inadequate anti-cancer activity in solid tumors limits its clinical application. In this study, we utilized the multiple cancer cell lines, which are less sensitive to the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126, combining animal model and clinical data to investigate the underlying mechanism.\nMETHODS: IncuCyte S3 was used to explore the difference in the responsiveness of hematological tumor cells and solid tumor cells to GSK126. Transcriptome and metabolome of B16F10 cells after GSK126 treatment were analyzed and the distinct changes in the metabolic profile were revealed. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot experiments were used to further verify the multi-omics data. ChIP-qPCR was performed to detected H3K27me3 enrichment of target genes. Finally, the anti-tumor effects of combining GSK126 and lipid metabolism drugs were observed with IncuCyte S3 platform, CCK-8 and animal model respectively.\nFINDINGS: We found that although the proliferative phenotype did not show strong difference upon treatment with GSK126, the transcriptome and metabolome changed profoundly. GSK126 treatment led to broad shifts in glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Lipid synthesis was strengthened manifested by the increasing abundance of unsaturated fatty acids. SCD1 and ELOVL2 were regulated by H3K27me3 at gene regulatory region, and upregulated by EZH2 knockdown and inhibitors. SCD1 knockdown increased cellular sensitivity to GSK126. Based on the findings above, the application of the combination with SCD1 inhibitor significantly attenuated the proliferation of cancer and increased the sensitivity to GSK126 by suppressing desaturation of fatty acids.\nINTERPRETATION: Dysregulated lipid metabolism can blunt the sensitivity of cancer cells to GSK126. These characteristics shed light on the novel combination therapy strategies to combat tumor resistance.\nFUNDING: National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81672091, No.91749107 and No. 81972966).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Targeting ferroptosis has been identified as a promising approach for the development of cancer therapies. Monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) is a type of lipid that plays a crucial role in inhibiting ferroptosis. Ficolin 3 (FCN3) is a component of the complement system, serving as a recognition molecule against pathogens in the lectin pathway. Recent studies have reported that FCN3 demonstrates inhibitory effects on the progression of certain tumors. However, whether FCN3 can modulate lipid metabolism and ferroptosis remains largely unknown.\nMETHODS: Cell viability, BODIPY-C11 staining, and MDA assay were carried out to detect ferroptosis. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and xenograft models were utilized to investigate the effect of FCN3 on the development of HCC in vivo. A metabonomic analysis was conducted to assess alterations in intracellular and HCC intrahepatic lipid levels.\nRESULTS: Our study elucidates a substantial decrease in the expression of FCN3, a component of the complement system, leads to MUFA accumulation in human HCC specimens and thereby significantly promotes ferroptosis resistance. Overexpression of FCN3 efficiently sensitizes HCC cells to ferroptosis, resulting in the inhibition of the oncogenesis and progression of both primary HCC and subcutaneous HCC xenograft. Mechanistically, FCN3 directly binds to the insulin receptor β (IR-β) and its pro-form (pro-IR), inhibiting pro-IR cleavage and IR-β phosphorylation, ultimately resulting in IR-β inactivation. This inactivation of IR-β suppresses the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), which subsequently suppresses the transcription of genes related to de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and lipid desaturation, and consequently downregulates intracellular MUFA levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism by which FCN3 enhances the sensitivity of HCC cells to ferroptosis, indicating that targeting FCN3-induced ferroptosis is a promising strategy for HCC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Patients with peritoneal metastasis (PM) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have poorer overall survival outcomes than those without PM. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment and mediate CRC progression and PM. It is imperative to identify and develop novel therapeutic targets for PM-CRC driven by CAFs. Using lipidomics, we reveal that the abundance of phosphatidylcholine (PC) with unsaturated acyl chains was increased in clinical PM-CRC specimens. Additionally, we found that CAFs were present at a higher relative abundance in primary PM-CRC tumors and that membrane fluidity in CRC cells was increased after incubation with CAF-conditioned medium (CM) through three independent methods: lipidomics, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and generalized polarization. Then, we found that increased membrane fluidity can enhance glucose uptake and metabolism, as supported by real-time bioenergetics analysis and U-13C glucose labeling. Interestingly, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (uS-FAs), was expressed at low levels in PM and associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. Importantly, by untargeted metabolomics analysis and fatty acid ([U-13C]-stearic acid) tracing analyses, we found that CRC cells take up lipids and lipid-like metabolites secreted from CAFs, which may compensate for low SCD expression. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that sodium palmitate (C16:0) treatment could decrease the CAF-induced change in cell membrane fluidity, limit glucose metabolism, suppress cell invasiveness, and impair tumor growth and intraperitoneal dissemination. An increased C16:0 concentration was shown to induce apoptosis linked to lipotoxicity. Furthermore, C16:0 effectively enhanced the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in vitro and was well tolerated in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that adding the saturated fatty acid (S-FA) C16:0 to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may open new opportunities for treating PM-CRC in the future.",

Here we show that pharmacologically induced lipotoxicity represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LXRα-induced liponeogenesis and Raf-1 inhibition are synthetic lethal in HCC owing to a toxic accumulation of saturated fatty acids. Raf-1 was found to bind and activate SCD1, and conformation-changing DFG-out Raf inhibitors could disrupt this interaction, thereby blocking fatty acid desaturation and inducing lethal lipotoxicity. Studies in genetically engineered and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced HCC mouse models and xenograft models of human HCC revealed that therapies comprising LXR agonists and Raf inhibitors were well tolerated and capable of overcoming therapy resistance in HCC. Conceptually, our study suggests pharmacologically induced lipotoxicity as a new mode for metabolic targeting of liver cancer.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adaptative desaturation in fatty acid (FA) is an emerging hallmark of cancer metabolic plasticity. Desaturases such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) have been implicated in multiple cancers, and their dominant and compensatory effects have recently been highlighted. However, how tumors initiate and sustain their self-sufficient FA desaturation to maintain phenotypic transition remains elusive. This study aimed to explore the molecular orchestration of SCD and FADS2 and their specific reprogramming mechanisms in response to cancer progression.\nMETHODS: The potential interactions between SCD and FADS2 were explored by bioinformatics analyses across multiple cancer cohorts, which guided subsequent functional and mechanistic investigations. The expression levels of desaturases were investigated with online datasets and validated in both cancer tissues and cell lines. Specific desaturation activities were characterized through various isomer-resolved lipidomics methods and sensitivity assays using desaturase inhibitors. In-situ lipid profiling was conducted using multiplex stimulated Raman scattering imaging. Functional assays were performed both in vitro and in vivo, with RNA-sequencing employed for the mechanism verification.\nRESULTS: After integration of the RNA-protein-metabolite levels, the data revealed that a reprogramming from SCD-dependent to FADS2-dependent desaturation was linked to cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and progression in both patients and cell lines. FADS2 overexpression and SCD suppression concurrently maintained EMT plasticity. A FADS2/β-catenin self-reinforcing feedback loop facilitated the degree of lipid unsaturation, membrane fluidity, metastatic potential and EMT signaling. Moreover, SCD inhibition triggered a lethal apoptosis but boosted survival plasticity by inducing EMT and enhancing FA uptake via adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation. Notably, this desaturation reprogramming increased transforming growth factor-β2, effectively sustaining aggressive phenotypes and metabolic plasticity during EMT.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed a metabolic reprogramming from SCD-dependent to FADS2-dependent desaturation during cancer EMT and progression, which concurrently supports EMT plasticity. Targeting desaturation reprogramming represents a potential vulnerability for cancer metabolic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and de novo lipogenesis is a key driver of several cancer types through highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) signaling precursors such as arachidonic acid. The human chromosome 11q13 locus has long been established as the most frequently amplified in a variety of human cancers. The fatty acid desaturase genes (FADS1, FADS2 and FADS3) responsible for HUFA biosynthesis localize to the 11q12-13.1 region. FADS2 activity is promiscuous, catalyzing biosynthesis of several unsaturated fatty acids by Δ6, Δ8, and Δ4 desaturation. Our main aim here is to review known and putative consequences of FADS2 dysregulation due to effects on the 11q13 locus potentially driving various cancer types. FADS2 silencing causes synthesis of sciadonic acid (5Z,11Z,14Z-20:3) in MCF7 cells and breast cancer in vivo. 5Z,11Z,14Z-20:3 is structurally identical to arachidonic acid (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-20:4) except it lacks the internal Δ8 double bond required for prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, among other eicosanoids. Palmitic acid has substrate specificity for both SCD and FADS2. Melanoma, prostate, liver and lung cancer cells insensitive to SCD inhibition show increased FADS2 activity and sapienic acid biosynthesis. Elevated serum mead acid levels found in hepatocellular carcinoma patients suggest an unsatisfied demand for arachidonic acid. FADS2 circular RNAs are at high levels in colorectal and lung cancer tissues. FADS2 circular RNAs are associated with shorter overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. The evidence thusfar supports an effort for future research on the role of FADS2 as a tumor suppressor in a range of neoplastic disorders.",

We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies to evaluate these associations. We identified relevant studies by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. We used random-effects models to estimate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Overall, the search yielded 20 studies (1 pooled analysis of 12 cohort studies, 5 cohorts, and 14 case-control studies). The summary RR for EOC for the highest versus lowest categories of total dietary fat intake was 1.12 (95%CI= 0.95-1.33; I2 = 77.4%; n = 14). The RRs were not significant when fats were divided into plant-based fats (RR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.77-1.13; n = 6), animal-based fats (RR = 1.15, 95%CI = 0.95-1.39; n = 8), dairy-based fats (RR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.88-1.18; n = 3), saturated FAs (RR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.93-1.17; n = 12), monounsaturated FAs (RR = 0.98, 95%CI = 0.84-1.13; n = 10), polyunsaturated FAs (RR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.81-1.12; n = 10), and trans-unsaturated FAs (RR = 1.15, 95%CI = 0.98-1.36; n = 3). Similar non-significant results were also observed in most of the subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest a lack of evidence for associations between dietary fat and FA intakes and EOC risk. Further analyses should be conducted to assess the associations with other types of fat, and the results should be stratified by tumor invasiveness and EOC histology.",

We demonstrate that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-49, enables the response to this physiological change by increasing the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation and fatty-acid desaturation. The coordinated augmentation of these processes is critical for germline-less animals to maintain their lipid stores and to sustain de novo fat synthesis during adulthood.

Accordingly, NHR-49 overexpression in fertile animals extends their lifespan modestly. In fertile adults, nhr-49 expression is DAF-16/FOXO and TCER-1/TCERG1 independent although its depletion causes age-related lipid abnormalities. Our data provide molecular insights into how reproductive stimuli are integrated into global metabolic changes to alter the lifespan of the animal.

    "abstract": "The fatty acid (FA) composition of red blood cell (RBC) membrane phospholipids of cancer patients can reflect tumor status, dietary intakes, and cancer type or therapy. However, the characteristic membrane profiles have so far not yet defined as a potential biomarker to monitor disease evolution. The present work provides the first evidence of cancer metabolic signatures affecting cell membranes that are independent of nutritional habits. From the Oncology Outpatient Unit of the Onkologikoa hospital, two groups of cancer patients (n = 54) and healthy controls (n = 37) were recruited, and mature RBCs membrane phospholipids were analyzed for FA profiling (GC-MS). Dietary habits were evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. The adjusted Analysis of Covariance Test (ANCOVA) model revealed cancer patients to have a lower relative percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (C16:0 (5.7%); C18:0 (15.9%)), and higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (9c-C18:1 (12.9%) and 11c-C18:1 (54.5%)), compared to controls. In line with this, we observe that the desaturase enzymatic index (delta-9 desaturase (Δ9D), +28.3%) and the membrane saturation index (SI = SFA/MUFA; -27.3%) were similarly modulated. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) families showed an increase of n-6 C18:2 and C20:3 (15.7% and 22.2% respectively), with no differences in n-6 C20:4 and n-3 PUFA (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)). Importantly, these changes were found independent of foods and fat intakes from the diet. The membrane lipid profile in RBC was useful to ascertain the presence of two main metabolic signatures of increased desaturation activity and omega-6 in cancer patients, statistically independent from dietary habits.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a deadly brain tumor for which there is no cure. The presence of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) contributes to the heterogeneous nature of the disease and makes developing effective therapies challenging. Glioblastoma cells have been shown to influence their environment by releasing biological nanostructures known as extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here, we investigated the role of GSC-derived nanosized EVs (<200 nm) in glioblastoma heterogeneity, plasticity, and aggressiveness, with a particular focus on their protein, metabolite, and fatty acid content. We showed that conditioned medium and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from cells of one glioblastoma subtype induced transcriptomic and proteomic changes in cells of another subtype. We found that GSC-derived sEVs are enriched in proteins playing a role in the transmembrane transport of amino acids, carboxylic acids, and organic acids, growth factor binding, and metabolites associated with amino acid, carboxylic acid, and sugar metabolism. This suggests a dual role of GSC-derived sEVs in supplying neighboring GSCs with valuable metabolites and proteins responsible for their transport. Moreover, GSC-derived sEVs were enriched in saturated fatty acids, while their respective cells were high in unsaturated fatty acids, supporting that the loading of biological cargos into sEVs is a highly regulated process and that GSC-derived sEVs could be sources of saturated fatty acids for the maintenance of glioblastoma cell metabolism. Interestingly, sEVs isolated from GSCs of the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes are enriched in specific sets of proteins, metabolites, and fatty acids, suggesting a molecular collaboration between transcriptionally different glioblastoma cells. In summary, this study revealed the complexity of GSC-derived sEVs and unveiled their potential contribution to tumor heterogeneity and critical cellular processes commonly deregulated in glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mammalian cells both import exogenous fatty acids and synthesize them de novo. Palmitate, the end product of fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a substrate for stearoyl-CoA desaturases (Δ-9 desaturases) that introduce a single double bond into fatty acyl-CoA substrates such as palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA. This process is particularly upregulated in lipogenic tissues and cancer cells. Tracer methodology is needed to determine uptake versus de novo synthesis of lipids and subsequent chain elongation and desaturation. Here we describe an NMR method to determine the uptake of 13C-palmitate from the medium into HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells, and the subsequent desaturation and incorporation into complex lipids.\nRESULTS: Exogenous 13C16-palmitate was absorbed from the medium by HCT116 cells and incorporated primarily into complex glycerol lipids. Desaturase activity was determined from the quantification of double bonds in acyl chains, which was greatly reduced by ablation of the major desaturase SCD1.\nSIGNIFICANCE: The NMR approach requires minimal sample preparation, is non-destructive, and provides direct information about the level of saturation and incorporation of fatty acids into complex lipids.",

    "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important for immune function. Limited evidence indicates that immune cell activation involves endogenous PUFA synthesis, but this has not been characterised. To address this, we measured metabolism of 18:3n-3 in quiescent and activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and in Jurkat T cell leukaemia. PBMCs from men and women (n = 34) were incubated with [1-13C]18:3n-3 with or without Concanavalin A (Con. A). 18:3n-3 conversion was undetectable in unstimulated PBMCs, but up-regulated when stimulated. The main products were 20:3n-3 and 20:4n-3, while 18:4n-3 was undetectable, suggesting initial elongation and Δ8 desaturation. PUFA synthesis was 17.4-fold greater in Jurkat cells than PBMCs. The major products of 18:3n-3 conversion in Jurkat cells were 20:4n-3, 20:5n-3, and 22:5n-3. 13C Enrichment of 18:4n-3 and 20:3n-3 suggests parallel initial elongation and Δ6 desaturation. The FADS2 inhibitor SC26196 reduced PBMC, but not Jurkat cell, proliferation suggesting PUFA synthesis is involved in regulating mitosis in PBMCs. Con. A stimulation increased FADS2, FADS1, ELOVL5 and ELOVL4 mRNA expression in PBMCs. A single transcript corresponding to the major isoform of FADS2, FADS20001, was detected in PBMCs and Jurkat cells. PBMC activation induced hypermethylation of a 470bp region in the FADS2 5'-regulatory sequence. This region was hypomethylated in Jurkat cells compared to quiescent PBMCs. These findings show that PUFA synthesis involving initial elongation and Δ8 desaturation is involved in regulating PBMC proliferation and is regulated via transcription possibly by altered DNA methylation. These processes were dysregulated in Jurkat cells. This has implications for understanding the regulation of mitosis in normal and transformed lymphocytes.",

A primary objective of this study was to determine whether there might be differences in the anticancer activity of 9,11-CLA and 10,12-CLA. This was achieved by evaluating the reduction in premalignant lesions and carcinomas in the mammary gland of rats that had been treated with a single dose of methylnitrosourea and given 0.5% of either highly purified CLA isomer in the diet. Our results showed that the anticancer efficacies of the two isomers were very similar. At 6 wk after carcinogen administration, the total number of premalignant lesions was reduced by 33-36%. At 24 wk, the total number of mammary carcinomas was reduced by 35-40%. The concentration of each CLA isomer and its respective metabolites was analyzed in the mammary fat pad. Tissue level of 10,12-CLA was much lower than that of 9,11-CLA. The pool of metabolites from each isomer was very similar between the two groups and represented only a small fraction of total conjugated diene fatty acids. Feeding of 9,11-CLA resulted in minimal changes in other unsaturated fatty acids. In contrast, feeding of 10,12-CLA produced a wider spectrum of perturbations. Small but significant increases in 16:1 and 16:2 were detected; these were accompanied by decreases in 20:2, 20:3, 20:4, 22:4, and 22:6. The above observation suggests that 10,12-CLA might be more potent than 9,11-CLA in interfering with elongation and desaturation of linoleic and linolenic acids. In summary, our study showed that, at the 0.5% dose level, the anticancer activity of 9,11-CLA and 10,12-CLA was very similar, even though accumulation of 10,12-CLA in the mammary tissue was considerably less than that of 9,11-CLA.

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The arginine methyltransferase CARM1 exhibits high expression levels in several human cancers, with the trend also observed in ovarian cancer. However, therapeutic approaches targeting tumors that overexpress CARM1 have not been explored. Cancer cells exploit metabolic reprogramming such as fatty acids for their survival. Here we report that CARM1 promotes monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid reprogramming represents a metabolic vulnerability for CARM1-expressing ovarian cancer. CARM1 promotes the expression of genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes of de novo fatty acid metabolism such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). In addition, CARM1 upregulates stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) that produces monounsaturated fatty acid by desaturation. Thus, CARM1 enhances de novo fatty acids synthesis which was subsequently utilized for synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Consequently, inhibition of SCD1 suppresses the growth of ovarian cancer cells in a CARM1 status-dependent manner, which was rescued by the addition of monounsaturated fatty acids. Consistently, CARM1-expressing cells were more tolerant to the addition of saturated fatty acids. Indeed, SCD1 inhibition demonstrated efficacy against ovarian cancer in both orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic mouse models in a CARM1-dependent manner. In summary, our data show that CARM1 reprograms fatty acid metabolism and targeting SCD1 through pharmacological inhibition can serve as a potent therapeutic approach for CARM1-expressing ovarian cancers.\nSIGNIFICANCE: CARM1 reprograms fatty acid metabolism transcriptionally to support ovarian cancer growth by producing monounsaturated fatty acids, supporting SCD1 inhibition as a rational strategy for treating CARM1-expressing ovarian cancer.",

Enrichment of [(13)C] 18:1 cis-11 confirmed 18:1 cis-11 is an elongation product of 16:1. Additionally, [(13)C] label was seen in 20:1 cis-13 and cis-9, cis-11 CLA. Synthesis of [(13)C] 16:0 from [(13)C] 2 was reduced (P < 0.05) in palmitoleic acid and cis-vaccenic acid-treated compared with control cells following 36 h incubation. By 12 h of [(13)C] 18:0 incubation, cells supplemented with palmitoleic acid had reduced (P < 0.05) [(13)C] 18:1 cis-9 compared with all other treatments. Gene expression and fatty acid results support isotopic data for lipogenesis and desaturation. Therefore, palmitoleic acid is actively elongated in vitro and its elongation product, cis-vaccenic acid, can also reduce lipogenesis. However, inhibition of desaturation can be directly attributed to palmitoleic acid and not its elongation products, 18:1 cis-11 or 20:1 cis-13.",

To create a steatotic environment, we treated BFH12 with stearic acid, palmitic acid, or oleic acid in non-toxic doses. Thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography were used to analyze lipid classes and fatty acid pattern, and qPCR was used to quantify gene expression of relevant target genes. Lipid droplets were visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy and evaluated for number and size. Treatment with oleic acid increased triglycerides, as well as lipid droplet count per cell and upregulated carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, which correlates with findings of in vivo models. Oleic acid was largely incorporated into triglycerides, phospholipids, and non-esterified fatty acids. Stearic acid was found mainly in non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides, whereas palmitic acid was mainly desaturated to palmitoleic acid. All three fatty acids downregulated stearyl-CoA-desaturase 1. In conclusion, BFH12 can acquire a steatotic phenotype by incorporating and accumulating fatty acids.

In this study, we tried to examine plasma Saturated Fatty Acid (SFA) and Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (MUFA) composition in Behçet's Disease (BD) patients. The associations between the circulating FA levels and some markers of inflammation have also been investigated.\nMETHODS: This study is a cross-sectional one. In fact, a total of 101 BD patients and healthy controls group of 99 subjects are enrolled. Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Capillary Split/Splitless Injector and flame ionization detector was used to analyze the plasma SFA and MUFA compositions. The high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) and fibrinogen levels were measured using standard techniques.\nRESULTS: BD patients had significantly higher proportions of Mystiric Acid (MA), Palmitic Acid (PAM), Palmitoleic Acid (POA) and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD)-16, compared to controls.The results revealed that patients with severe involvements had high levels of POA and total MUFA associated with higher SCD-16 activity compared to those with minor ones. The receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed that POA could well discriminate BD patients with severe clinical manifestations. In the bivariate analysis, hsCRP was found to be positively correlated with total SAFA and POA elongase activity index but negatively correlated with SCD-18 activity index. The STA, POA, elongase and SCD-16 activity index are correlated with fibrinogen. On the other hand, the multivariate analysis showed that POA remained associated with higher levels of hsCRP.\nCONCLUSION: Unfavourable plasma SFA and MUFA profile were reported in BD patients. POA, which is associated with higher plasma hsCRP level, may play a role in the pathogenesis of BD.",

    "abstract": "Focusing on the differences in the catalytic properties of two type I fatty acid synthases FasA and FasB, the fasA gene was disrupted in an oleic acid-producing Corynebacterium glutamicum strain. The resulting oleic acid-requiring strain whose fatty acid synthesis depends only on FasB exhibited almost exclusive production (217 mg/L) of palmitic acid (C16:0) from 1% glucose under the conditions supplemented with the minimum concentration of sodium oleate for growth. Plasmid-mediated amplification of fasB led to a 1.47-fold increase in palmitic acid production (320 mg/L), while fasB disruption resulted in no fatty acid production, with excretion of malonic acid (30 mg/L). Next, aiming at conversion of the palmitic acid producer to a producer of palmitoleic acid (POA, C16:1Δ9), we introduced the Pseudomonas nitroreducens Δ9-desaturase genes desBC into the palmitic acid producer. Although this resulted in failure, we noticed the emergence of suppressor mutants that exhibited the oleic acid-non-requiring phenotype. Production experiments revealed that one such mutant M-1 undoubtedly produced POA (17 mg/L) together with palmitic acid (173 mg/L). Whole genomic analysis and subsequent genetic analysis identified the suppressor mutation of strain M-1 as a loss-of-function mutation for the DtxR protein, a global regulator of iron metabolism. Considering that DesBC are both iron-containing enzymes, we investigated the conditions for increased iron availability to improve the DesBC-dependent conversion ratio of palmitic acid to POA. Eventually, supplementation of both hemin and the iron chelator protocatechuic acid in the engineered strain dramatically enhanced POA production to 161 mg/L with a conversion ratio of 80.1%. Cellular fatty acid analysis revealed that the POA-producing cells were really equipped with unnatural membrane lipids comprised predominantly of palmitic acid (85.1% of total cellular fatty acids), followed by non-native POA (12.4%).",

One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on lipid metabolism, and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.\nMETHODS: Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), lauric acid (C12:0), tridecanoic acid (C13:0), myristic acid (C14:0), pentadecanoic acid (C15:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and behenic acid (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (palmitoleic acid (C16:1), oleic acid (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic acid (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (linoleic acid (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6), arachidonic acid (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.\nRESULTS: Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.\nCONCLUSION: Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.",

    "abstract": "An increase in conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a natural fatty acid present in our diet, which possesses anticarcinogenic and antiatherogenic activities in experimental models, has been found in both the plasma and adipose tissue of end-stage chronic renal failure (ESCRF) patients. Increased levels of retinol have also been found in those patients, due to a reduced excretion of the retinol-binding protein. Since retinol is known to influence lipid metabolism, we evaluated whether changes in retinol, CLA, and other fatty acids are correlated in the plasma of CRF patients. We measured CLA, retinol, and unsaturated fatty acids in the plasma of the following groups: (A) 35 ESCRF patients; (B) 20 hemodialysis (HD) patients; (C) 20 healthy controls. Subjects with total cholesterol and/or triglycerides higher than 250 mg/dL were excluded. We found a significant increase in CLA, retinol, palmitoleic (16:1), and oleic (18:1) acids in ESCRF patients. In HD patients we found a similar pattern, however, CLA increase was not significant. No changes were observed in the other fatty acids measured. In the groups of ESCRF and HD patients, a positive correlation between the levels of plasma retinol and CLA, and between retinol and 16:1 was found. These correlations were not detected in controls. The abnormal levels of plasma retinol in CRF patients might partly explain the changes in CLA and 16:1. The influence of retinol levels on these fatty acids might be due to an induction of delta 9 desaturase. In fact, 16:1 is known to be produced, partly, by delta 9 desaturation of palmitic acid. Moreover, the formation of CLA from delta 9 desaturation of vaccenic acid-a trans-monounsaturated fatty acid present in our diet-has recently been demonstrated in humans. Nevertheless, our data do not represent direct evidence supporting an increased delta 9 desaturase activity in CRF patients. Another possible explanation might be a variation in the exogenous intake.",

Recently, some consumers voiced concerns about butter being harder at room temperature and questioned if it was caused by palmitic acid supplementation of dairy cows. Our hypothesis was that increasing palmitic acid intake would linearly increase palmitic acid in milk fat and, therefore, increase the solid fat content (SFC) of milk fat at 20°C, whereas increasing stearic acid intake would increase both stearic and oleic acid in milk fat and not change the SFC of milk fat at 20°C. A total of 12 second-lactation Holstein cows (106 ± 31 DIM) were arranged in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with a dose escalation design within period and ≥10 d washouts between periods. Treatments included a no-supplement fat control (CON), a fatty acid (FA) supplement high in palmitic acid (PA; 88% palmitic and 8% oleic), and a FA supplement high in stearic acid (SA; 81% stearic and 10% oleic). The FA supplements were fed at increasing doses every 4 d, targeting 150, 300, 500, and 750 g/d. Milk samples were collected on d 3 and 4 of each dose, composited, and milk fat extracted from the fat cake by centrifugation. The FA profile of whole milk was analyzed using GC, and the melting properties of milk fat were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with preplanned contrasts testing CON versus PA and CON versus SA at each dose level. Increasing PA progressively increased palmitic acid in milk fat, whereas increasing SA progressively increased both stearic and oleic acid. At 750 g/d, PA increased palmitic and palmitoleic acid in milk fat 5.7 and 0.25 percentage units compared with CON, whereas SA increased stearic and oleic acid in milk fat by 2.4 units and 3.0 units compared with CON. The SFC of milk fat at 20°C was linearly increased by PA but was decreased by SA. At the 750 g/d dose, PA increased SFC by 5.3 percentage units, whereas SA decreased it 3.2 percentage units compared with CON. In conclusion, increasing palmitic acid intake increases the SFC of milk fat at room temperature, whereas increasing stearic acid modestly decreases it, likely due to differences in the rates of desaturation of these FA by the stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme.",

In experiment 2, C18:3 (100 and 300 microM) but not C18:0 decreased P4 and E2 metabolism. Overall, the most profound increase (approximately 60%) in half-life of P4 and E2 was observed with incubations of 300 microM C18:3 in both in vitro experiments. Based on these in vitro results, in experiment 3 linseed oil (rich in C18:3) was supplemented into the abomasum and acute effects on metabolism of E2 and P4 were evaluated. Cows (n=4) had endogenous E2 and P4 minimized (corpus luteum regressed, follicles aspirated) before receiving continuous intravenous infusion of E2 and P4 to analyze metabolic clearance rate for these hormones during abomasal infusion of saline (control) or 70 mL of linseed oil every 4h for 28h. Linseed oil infusion increased C18:3 in plasma by 46%; however, metabolic clearance rate for E2 and P4 were similar for control cows compared with linseed-treated cows. Thus, in vitro experiments indicated that E2 and P4 metabolism can be inhibited by high concentrations of C18:3. Nevertheless, in vivo, linseed oil did not acutely inhibit E2 and P4 metabolism, perhaps because insufficient C18:3 concentrations (increased to approximately 8 microM) were achieved. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism(s) of fatty acid inhibition of P4 and E2 metabolism and to discover practical methods to mimic this effect in vivo.",

The ratio of 16:1n-7 to 16:0 [SCD1₁₆] in plasma triacylglycerol FA has been used as an index to reflect liver SCD1₁₆ activity and has been proposed as a biomarker of FA synthesis, although this use has not been validated by comparison with isotopically measured de novo lipogenesis (DNL(Meas)).\nOBJECTIVE: We investigated plasma lipid 16:1n-7 and FA indexes of elongation and desaturation in relation to lipogenesis.\nDESIGN: In this cross-sectional investigation of metabolism, 24 overweight adults, who were likely to have elevated DNL, consumed D2O for 10 d and had liver fat (LF) measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triacylglycerols and plasma free FA [nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs)] were analyzed by using gas chromatography for the FA composition (molar percentage) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry for deuterium enrichment.\nRESULTS: In all subjects, VLDL-triacylglycerol 16:1n-7 was significantly (P < 0.01) related to DNL(Meas) (r = 0.56), liver fat (r = 0.53), and adipose insulin resistance (r = 0.56); similar positive relations were shown with the SCD1₁₆ index, and the pattern in NEFAs echoed that of VLDL-triacylglycerols. Compared with subjects with low LF (3.1 ± 2.7%; n = 11), subjects with high LF (18.4 ± 3.6%; n = 13) exhibited a 45% higher VLDL-triacylglycerol 16:1n-7 molar percentage (P < 0.01), 16% of subjects had lower 18:2n-6 (P = 0.01), and 27% of subjects had higher DNL as assessed by using a published DNL index (ratio of 16:0 to 18:2n-6; P = 0.03), which was isotopically confirmed by DNL(Meas) (increased 2.5-fold; P < 0.01). Compared with 16:0 in the diet, the low amount of dietary 16:1n-7 in VLDL-triacylglycerols corresponded to a stronger signal of elevated DNL.\nCONCLUSION: The current data provide support for the use of the VLDL-triacylglycerol 16:1n-7 molar percentage as a biomarker for elevated liver fat when isotope use is not feasible; however, larger-scale confirmatory studies are needed.",

For each unit increase in palmitoleic acid (OR, 3.75; P = 0.04) or elaidic acid (OR, 2.92; P = 0.04), an individual was more likely to have adenomas relative to no colon polyps.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology of hypertriglyceridemia is complex hampering effective therapeutic strategies. Increased central parasympathetic nerve activity was shown to inhibit hepatic triglyceride (TG) excretion via modulation of liver stearyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1 activity in rodents. We evaluated the impact of 7-h lactate clamping on VLDL-TG homeostasis in humans.\nMETHODS: Eight normolipidemic, male subjects were subjected to a continuous infusion of l-lactate (target concentration 3 mmol/L) or saline for 7 h in random order on two separate occasions. TG kinetics in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL1 and 2) were measured after a bolus injection of [1,1,2,3,3]-(2)H5-glycerol. Palmitic acid (16:0) and palmitoleic acid (16:1) in VLDL1 and VLDL2 were measured as a reflection of liver SCD1 activity.\nRESULTS: Plasma TG levels changed by 0.16 ± 0.09 mmol/L during lactate vs -0.15 ± 0.08 mmol/L during saline (P < 0.05). VLDL1 16:1/16:0 ratio increased to 1.2 ± 0.7 during lactate versus a decrease during saline by -1.5 ± 0.6 (p = 0.01). During lactate VLDL1-TG excretion was higher compared to saline (1604 [827-2870] versus 1285 [505-2155] μmol glycerol; p < 0.05), trending toward higher VLDL1-TG pool sizes during lactate (28%; p = 0.07 versus saline).\nCONCLUSIONS: In normolipidemic men, 7-h l-lactate clamp increases, rather than decreases SCD1 activity and hepatic TG secretion leading to elevated plasma TG levels. These conflicting data between human and rodents on central regulation of hepatic TG excretion illustrate that experimental findings on the role of the central nervous system in lipid metabolism should be interpreted with caution.",

The study is conducted to find out the changes in the lipid metabolism of HBV-cirrhosis patients.\nMETHODS: In the present study, serum lipid profiles of patients with HBV-cirrhosis were assessed by utilizing micro-lab and gas chromatography, while risk factors for transmission of HBV-cirrhosis studied through the standard questionnaire.\nRESULTS: The epidemiological and etiological risk factors strongly associated with HBV-cirrhosis patients compared to controls, included as family history, shave from the barber, blood transfusion (without proper screening), mutual sharing of household contents, positive surgery history, and dental treatment. The HBV-cirrhosis patients have significantly lower level (p < 0.001) of lipid profile including total cholesterol (96.65 mg/dl), TAG (82.85 mg/dl), VLDL-C (16.57 mg/dl), LDL-C (68.27 mg/dl), HDL-C (27 mg/dl) and total lipid (424.76 mg/dl) in comparison to controls, indicating hypolipidemia in patients. The MELD score indicated mild prognostic values of the hepatic function for the study group. The result of total fatty acid composition of HBV-cirrhotic patients with comparison of control subjects reveals that palmitic (24.54 g/100 g) and palmitoleic acid (4.65 g/100 g) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher whereas eicosatrienoic (0.09 g/100 g), arachidonic (3.57 g/100 g), linoleic (22.75 g/100 g) and α-linolenic acid (0.12 g/100 g) were significantly lower. Marker for stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD = ∆9-desaturase) activity i.e. palmitoleic: palmitic (0.2) and oleic: stearic acid (1.5) ratios, originated higher in HBV-cirrhotic patients, while PUFA: SFA (0.6) was lower in HBV-cirrhosis patients as compared with control subjects. The serum SFA and MUFA were increased while PUFA were reduced in both total and free form.\nCONCLUSION: Present study concluded that hypolipidemia observed in HBV-cirrhosis patients, MELD were found to be independent predictors of survival and alteration in fatty acid composition, possibly due to impairment in fatty acid metabolism by enzymatic elongation and desaturation.",

Objectives of this research were to quantify the amounts of palmitelaidic acid in beef samples and determine the effect of palmitelaidic acid supplementation on lipogenesis in bovine preadipocytes and adipocytes in vitro. For the first objective, palmitelaidic acid content of LM samples from steers finished on forage or concentrate systems was determined. Palmitelaidic acid in LM samples from forage-finished beef ranged from 10 to 17 mg/100 g of muscle corresponding to 0.52% to 0.65% of total fatty acids. Forage species grazed during finishing, and animal age at harvest also altered palmitelaidic acid concentrations and contents in the LM of forage-finished beef. Palmitelaidic acid concentration of concentrate-finished beef was lower (P < 0.05; 0.25% vs. 0.56%); however, because of increased (P < 0.05) total fatty acid content with concentrate finishing, amount of palmitelaidic acid was similar (P > 0.05) to beef from steers finished on pearl millet and greater (P < 0.05) than those finished on alfalfa. For the second objective, undifferentiated preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes were supplemented with 0 to 300 μM of palmitelaidic acid. Palmitelaidic acid supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) cell viability of undifferentiated preadipocytes at greater levels (150 and 300 μM) but did not affect (P > 0.05) the viability of differentiated adipocytes. In preadipocytes, palmitelaidic acid increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic and trans-11 vaccenic (C18:1 trans-11) acids at high levels of supplementation (300 μM). In adipocytes, palmitelaidic acid supplementation increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic acid, trans-11 vaccenic acid, and total fatty acid content. In addition, cis-9, trans-11 CLA also increased (P < 0.05) with palmitelaidic acid supplementation in adipocytes. These results indicate that palmitelaidic acid can be elongated in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and desaturated in adipocytes to generate trans-11 vaccenic acid and cis-9, trans-11 CLA, respectively. Beef products are a source of palmitelaidic acid in the human diet, which can be elongated and desaturated to produce trans-11 vaccenic acid and cis-9, trans-11 CLA.",

Elevated levels of circulating FFAs are associated with metabolic aberrations in humans.

Potentially, alterations in circulating levels of specific FFAs could also be important in terms of prognostic value. Various methods have been used to analyze FFAs. In this study, a straightforward and accurate method for the determination of FFAs in plasma has been established and evaluated, through conversion of plasma FFAs into acid fluorides followed by conversion to Weinreb amides (dimethylamide). The method is mild, efficient, selective, and quantitative for FFAs, when analyzed with capillary gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Standard curves were linear over the range of 1,000-20,000 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient (r(2)) of 0.998, and coefficient of variation of triplicate analysis was <10 %. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique was reproducible and repeatable, and recoveries were above 90 %. From the generated MS spectra, five specific FFAs were identified. An explicit interest was the quantification of palmitate (C16:0) and palmitoleate (C16:1), which have been connected with detrimental and positive effects on the insulin-producing beta cells, respectively.

To identify the fatty acid (FA) species involved and to understand the underlying mechanisms, pregnant Sv/129 wild-type (mPPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-null (Pparα-null) and humanized PPARα (hPPARα) mice were treated with diets containing 0%, 0.01%, 0.05% or 0.1% DEHP. Dams were dissected on gestational day 18 together with fetuses, and on postnatal day 2 together with newborns. n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated, saturated, and monounsaturated FAs in maternal plasma and in liver of wild-type offspring, and representative enzymes for FA desaturation and elongation in maternal liver, were measured. The plasma levels of linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid were higher in the pregnant control mPPARa mice than in Ppara-null and hPPARa mice. DEHP exposure significantly decreased the levels of these four FAs only in pregnant mPPARα mice. Plasma levels of many FAs were higher in pregnant mice than in postpartum ones in a genotype-independent manner, while it was lower in the livers of fetuses than pups. DEHP exposure slightly increased hepatic arachidonic acid, α-linolenic acid, palmitoleic acid and oleic acid in fetuses, but not in pups. However, DEHP exposure did not clearly influence FA desaturase 1 and 2 nor elongase 2 and 5 expressions in the liver of all maternal mice. Taken together, the levels of plasma four FAs with shorter carbon chains were higher in pregnant mPPARα mice than in other genotypes, and DEHP exposure decreased these specific FA concentrations only in mPPARα mice, similarly to triglyceride levels.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of various metabolic abnormalities which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Due to its increasing prevalence, it has become an important public health concern. Altered fatty acid (FA) composition and desaturase activities have been associated with several metabolic diseases, including MetS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of the plasma FA profile and desaturase activities with the MetS in a Mediterranean population at high risk of CVD.\nMETHODS: Baseline data from 427 participants aged 55-80 years who took part in the interventional PREDIMED study were obtained. Individual FA was determined in plasma and desaturase activities were estimated from product/precursor ratios. Odds ratios (OR) and partial correlation coefficients were used to examine these relations with MetS and its components, respectively.\nRESULTS: We found higher levels of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, estimated Δ(9)- or stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and estimated Δ(6) desaturase (D6D), and lower levels of C18:2n-6 in people with MetS compared to those without it. After adjustment for several confounders, only higher quartiles of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, and D6D were found to be associated with an increasing prevalence of MetS, while higher quartiles of C18:2n-6 were inversely associated with MetS. High proportions of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, C20:3n-6, SCD, and D6D, and decreased proportions of C18:2n-6 and estimated Δ(5)-desaturase (D5D) were associated with adverse profiles of several metabolic risk factors. Women showed more unhealthy FA pattern and lipid profiles than men, but only among those with MetS.\nCONCLUSION: A FA composition and estimated desaturase activities consisting in high levels of SFA, SCD and D6D, and low levels of PUFA and D5D are associated with increased MetS probability and are characteristic of people presenting MetS, especially women. These findings support those observed in non-Mediterranean populations in which an altered FA profile and estimated desaturase activities are associated with MetS.",

    "abstract": "Conjugated fatty acid is a collective term used for fatty acids with conjugated double bond systems. Seed oils from certain plants include conjugated linolenic acids, which have a conjugated triene system and are geometrical and positional isomers of α-linolenic acid. One of these isomers, jacaric acid (JA, 8c, 10t, 12c-18:3), has not been examined widely. Therefore, we investigated the absorption and metabolism of JA in normal animals (ICR mice). An oral dose of JA of 5 mg/day for 1 week had no effects on body weight, food intake and tissue weight of mice. JA was detected in the serum, kidney, liver, lung and epididymal white adipose tissue. Analysis of the fatty acid composition in liver and white adipose tissue showed a tendency to increase levels of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) such as palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) and to decrease levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) such as palmitoleic acid (16:1) and oleic acid (18:1). Thus, JA treatment decreased the desaturation index (16:1/16:0, 18:1/18:0) in liver and white adipose tissue. This index is used as an indicator of the activity of stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase (SCD), an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of MUFAs from SFAs. The change in this index indicates that JA inhibited SCD activity in ICR mice, and further experiments showed that JA also decreased the expression level of SCD-1 mRNA. Inhibition of SCD activity may have anti-obesity and anti-diabetes effects, and therefore the findings in this study suggest that JA may be effective for preventing obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Positional isomers of hexadecenoic acid are considered as fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties. The best known of them, palmitoleic acid (cis-9-hexadecenoic acid, 16:1n-7), has been identified as a lipokine with important beneficial actions in metabolic diseases. Hypogeic acid (cis-7-hexadecenoic acid, 16:1n-9) has been regarded as a possible biomarker of foamy cell formation during atherosclerosis. Notwithstanding the importance of these isomers as possible regulators of inflammatory responses, very little is known about the regulation of their levels and distribution and mobilization among the different lipid pools within the cell. In this work, we describe that the bulk of hexadecenoic fatty acids found in mouse peritoneal macrophages is esterified in a unique phosphatidylcholine species, which contains palmitic acid at the sn-1 position, and hexadecenoic acid at the sn-2 position. This species markedly decreases when the macrophages are activated with inflammatory stimuli, in parallel with net mobilization of free hexadecenoic acid. Using pharmacological inhibitors and specific gene-silencing approaches, we demonstrate that hexadecenoic acids are selectively released by calcium-independent group VIA phospholipase A2 under activation conditions. While most of the released hexadecenoic acid accumulates in free fatty acid form, a significant part is also transferred to other phospholipids to form hexadecenoate-containing inositol phospholipids, which are known to possess growth-factor-like-properties, and are also used to form fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids, compounds with known anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties. Collectively, these data unveil new pathways and mechanisms for the utilization of palmitoleic acid and its isomers during inflammatory conditions, and raise the intriguing possibility that part of the anti-inflammatory activity of these fatty acids may be due to conversion to other lipid mediators.",

This indicates that elevated levels of endogenous lipogenesis increase the risk of fracture and suggest a role for saturated fat in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.\nINTRODUCTION: Osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes are derived from a common mesenchymal progenitor, and experimental studies have indicated that increased adipogenesis can occur at the expense of osteoblasts, leading to bone loss. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) converts saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids and is a key enzyme in lipogenesis.\nMETHODS: Analysis was performed in a population-based, longitudinal cohort study of men (n = 2009). A product-to-precursor index (palmitoleic acid/palmitic acid) was used to estimate SCD activity in fasting serum analyzed in samples obtained at enrollment at age 50 years. Fractures were documented in 422 men during 35 years of follow-up. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the risk of fracture according to SCD activity index.\nRESULTS: The risk of fracture was highest among men with the highest levels of SCD activity index. Multivariable analysis of the risk of fracture in the highest quintile as compared to the lowest one showed that the rate ratio was 1.71 (95% CI 1.26-2.33) for any fracture, with an estimated population attributable risk of 15%. The risk was further increased within the highest quintile.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that elevated levels of endogenous lipogenesis increase the risk of fracture and suggest a role for saturated fat in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.",

Changes in the metabolism of these amino acids influence serum lipoprotein concentrations, although the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. However, recent evidence has suggested that the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) may be the link between these two metabolic pathways. SCD-1 is a key enzyme for the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Its main substrates C16:0 and C18:0 and products palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1) are the most abundant fatty acids in triglycerides, cholesterol esters and membrane phospholipids. A significant suppression of SCD-1 has been observed in several animal models with disrupted sulfur amino acid metabolism, and the activity of SCD-1 is also associated with the levels of these amino acids in humans. This enzyme also appears to be involved in the etiology of metabolic syndromes because its suppression results in decreased fat deposits (regardless of food intake), improved insulin sensitivity and higher basal energy expenditure. Interestingly, this anti-obesogenic phenotype has also been described in humans and animals with sulfur amino acid disorders, which is consistent with the hypothesis that SCD-1 activity is influenced by these amino acids, in particularly cysteine, which is a strong and independent predictor of SCD-1 activity and fat storage. In this narrative review, we discuss the evidence linking sulfur amino acids, SCD-1 and lipid metabolism.",

Ten mildly hypercholesterolaemic men consumed five, 114 g hamburger patties per week for two consecutive phases. Participants consumed high-SFA hamburger (MUFA:SFA = 0.95; produced from pasture-fed cattle) for 5 weeks, consumed their habitual diets for 3 weeks and then consumed high-MUFA hamburger (MUFA:SFA = 1.31; produced from grain-fed cattle) for 5 weeks.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The metabolic basis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is poorly understood, and the relationships between systemic abnormalities in metabolism and AD pathogenesis are unclear. Understanding how global perturbations in metabolism are related to severity of AD neuropathology and the eventual expression of AD symptoms in at-risk individuals is critical to developing effective disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we undertook parallel metabolomics analyses in both the brain and blood to identify systemic correlates of neuropathology and their associations with prodromal and preclinical measures of AD progression.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Quantitative and targeted metabolomics (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ [identification and quantification] p180) assays were performed on brain tissue samples from the autopsy cohort of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (N = 44, mean age = 81.33, % female = 36.36) from AD (N = 15), control (CN; N = 14), and \"asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease\" (ASYMAD, i.e., individuals with significant AD pathology but no cognitive impairment during life; N = 15) participants. Using machine-learning methods, we identified a panel of 26 metabolites from two main classes-sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids-that discriminated AD and CN samples with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 83.33%, 86.67%, and 80%, respectively. We then assayed these 26 metabolites in serum samples from two well-characterized longitudinal cohorts representing prodromal (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], N = 767, mean age = 75.19, % female = 42.63) and preclinical (BLSA) (N = 207, mean age = 78.68, % female = 42.63) AD, in which we tested their associations with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-related brain atrophy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology, risk of conversion to incident AD, and trajectories of cognitive performance. We developed an integrated blood and brain endophenotype score that summarized the relative importance of each metabolite to severity of AD pathology and disease progression (Endophenotype Association Score in Early Alzheimer's Disease [EASE-AD]). Finally, we mapped the main metabolite classes emerging from our analyses to key biological pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. We found that distinct sphingolipid species including sphingomyelin (SM) with acyl residue sums C16:0, C18:1, and C16:1 (SM C16:0, SM C18:1, SM C16:1) and hydroxysphingomyelin with acyl residue sum C14:1 (SM (OH) C14:1) were consistently associated with severity of AD pathology at autopsy and AD progression across prodromal and preclinical stages. Higher log-transformed blood concentrations of all four sphingolipids in cognitively normal individuals were significantly associated with increased risk of future conversion to incident AD: SM C16:0 (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.430, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.703-11.520, p = 0.002), SM C16:1 (HR = 3.455, 95% CI = 1.516-7.873, p = 0.003), SM (OH) C14:1 (HR = 3.539, 95% CI = 1.373-9.122, p = 0.009), and SM C18:1 (HR = 2.255, 95% CI = 1.047-4.855, p = 0.038). The sphingolipid species identified map to several biologically relevant pathways implicated in AD, including tau phosphorylation, amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism, calcium homeostasis, acetylcholine biosynthesis, and apoptosis. Our study has limitations: the relatively small number of brain tissue samples may have limited our power to detect significant associations, control for heterogeneity between groups, and replicate our findings in independent, autopsy-derived brain samples.\nCONCLUSIONS: We present a novel framework to identify biologically relevant brain and blood metabolites associated with disease pathology and progression during the prodromal and preclinical stages of AD. Our results show that perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism are consistently associated with endophenotypes across preclinical and prodromal AD, as well as with AD pathology at autopsy. Sphingolipids may be biologically relevant biomarkers for the early detection of AD, and correcting perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism may be a plausible and novel therapeutic strategy in AD.",

The CFs of TAG standards decreased with increasing total acyl carbon number and degree of desaturation of TAG molecules. Also, there were no remarkable differences in the CFs between TAG positional isomers such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl-rac-glycerol, 1-stearoyl-2-palmitoyl-3-oleoyl-rac-glycerol, and 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-3-oleoyl-rac-glycerol, which cannot be separated by GC-FID. Furthermore, this method was able to predict the CFs of heterogeneous (AAB- and ABC-type) TAGs from the CFs of homogenous (AAA-, BBB-, and CCC-type) TAGs. In addition, the TAG composition in cocoa butter, palm oil, and canola oil was determined using CFs, and the results were found to be in good agreement with those reported in the literature.

Fatty acid (FA) composition, with special emphasis on oleic acid (C18:1) and palmitic acid (C16:0), is one of the most critical quality factors to be evaluated in VOO. For this reason, the profile of FAs is frequently used as a decision tool in olive breeding programs.\nRESULTS: A method based on gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) was used to study the influence of genotype on the concentration of ten of the most important FAs in VOOs from target crosses Arbequina × Arbosana, Picual × Koroneiki and Sikitita × Arbosana and their corresponding genitors Arbequina, Arbosana, Koroneiki, Picual and Sikitita. For this purpose, a targeted approach was selected for determination of esterified FAs (EFAs) and non-esterified FAs (NEFAs) in a dual analysis by the same chromatographic method. A Pearson analysis revealed correlations between pairs of FAs, which allowed detecting metabolic connections through desaturation and elongation enzymes. An ANOVA test (with P < 0.01) led to identification of C16:0 EFA, C16:1 EFA and C18:1 EFA and also C16:1 NEFA and C18:0 NEFA as the FAs more influenced by cross breeding. Statistical analysis was carried out by unsupervised analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) to look for variability sources.\nCONCLUSION: Crosses with a common genitor (Arbequina × Arbosana and Sikitita × Arbosana) were partially overlapped in the PCAs using the profile of FAs. The CA results revealed clear differences between Sikitita × Arbosana and Picual × Koroneiki crosses in the composition of the most significant FAs, while Arbequina × Arbosana was not properly discriminated from the other crosses.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical studies with animal models have demonstrated that cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), the predominant isomer found in milk fat from dairy cows, has anticarcinogenic effects. We recently demonstrated endogenous synthesis of cis-9, trans-11 CLA from ruminally derived trans-11 C18:1 by Delta(9)-desaturase in lactating dairy cows. The present study further examined endogenous synthesis of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and quantified its importance by increasing substrate supply using partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (PHVO) as a source of trans-11 C18:1 and blocking endogenous synthesis using sterculic oil (SO) as a source of cyclopropene fatty acids which specifically inhibit Delta(9)-desaturase. Four cows were abomasally infused with 1) control, 2) PHVO, 3) SO, and 4) PHVO+SO in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. With infusion of PHVO, cis-9, trans-11 CLA was increased by 17% in milk fat. Consistent with inhibition of desaturase, SO treatments increased milk fat ratios for the fatty acid pairs effected by Delta(9)-desaturase, C14:0/cis-9 C14:1, C16:0/cis-9 C16:1, and C18:0/cis-9 C18:1. The role of endogenous synthesis of CLA was evident from the 60-65% reduction in cis-9, trans-11 CLA which occurred in milk fat with SO treatments. cis-9 C14:1 originates from desaturation of C14:0 by Delta(9)-desaturase and can be used to estimate the extent of SO inhibition of Delta(9)-desaturase. When this correction factor was applied, endogenous synthesis was estimated to account for 78% of the total cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk fat. Thus, endogenous synthesis was the major source of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk fat of lactating cows.",

To uncover the mechanism involved, we explored the role of two known pathways involved in neurogenerative diseases, namely mitophagy, via deletion of the mitophagy factor PINK-1, and fatty acid desaturation, via deletion of the Δ9 desaturase FAT-5. Pink-1 deletion in GMC101 worms did not modify the life-prolonging and anti-paralysis effects of HA-114 but reduced the protective effect of R0179 against paralysis without affecting its life-prolonging effect. Upon fat5 deletion in GMC101 worms, the monounsaturated C14:1 and C16:1 FAs conserved their beneficial effect while the saturated C14:0 and C16:0 FAs did not. The beneficial effects of R0179 on both lifespan and paralysis remained unaffected by fat-5 deletion, while the beneficial effect of HA-114 on paralysis and lifespan was significantly reduced.\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively with clinical and preclinical evidence in other models, our results suggest that HA-114 or R0179 could be studied as potential therapeutical adjuncts in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",

Its role in the homeostasis of nonessential fatty acids is poorly understood. We report here a study on the cycling of saturated fatty acids and the effects of troglitazone in HepG2 cells in culture using [U-13C]stearate or [U-13C]oleate and mass isotopomer analysis. HepG2 cells were grown in the presence of 0.7 mmol/liter [U-13C]stearate or [U-13C]oleate, and in the presence and absence of 50 microM troglitazone for 72 h. Fatty acids extracted from cell pellets after saponification were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of uniformly 13C-labeled stearate (C18:0) and oleate (C18:1) resulted in chain shortening and produced uniformly labeled palmitate (C16:0) and palmitoleate (C16:1). In untreated cells, 16% of C16:0 was derived from C18:0 and 26% of C16:1 from C18:1 by chain shortening. Such contributions were significantly increased by troglitazone to 23.6 and 36.6%, respectively (p < 0.001). Desaturation of stearate contributed 67% of the oleate, while reduction of oleate contributed little to stearate (2%). The desaturation of C18:0 to C18:1 was not affected by troglitazone. Our results demonstrated a high degree of recycling of C18:0 and C18:1 to C16:0 and C16:1 through chain shortening and desaturation. Chain shortening was accompanied by chain elongation in the synthesis of other long chain fatty acids. Troglitazone specifically increased recycling by peroxisomal beta-oxidation of C18 to C16 fatty acids, and the interconversion of long chain fatty acids was associated with reduced de novo lipogenesis.",

The surfactants PEG-8-stearate, PEG-22-tocopheryl succinate (TPGS), PEG-3-oleate, PEG-9-oleate and PEG-9-lauryl ether were phosphorylated and incorporated in a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) exhibiting a defined PEG corona.

Significant enzyme induced charge conversion was observed for all P-PEG-surfactants, showing shifts from Δ3 mV to Δ31 mV. Surfactants comprising the shortest and longest PEG chain showed similar amplitudes (P-PEG-3-oleate: Δ11.9 mV; P-PEG-22-TPGS Δ10.2 mV), whereas P-PEG-8-stearate, P-PEG-9-oleate and P-PEG-9-lauryl ether bearing similarly long PEG chains but different lipophilic tail structures resulted in pronounced differences in amplitudes of Δ10.3 mV, Δ14.5 mV and Δ18.1 mV, respectively. Furthermore, an indirect correlation between the lipophilicity of P-PEG-surfactants and the obtained charge-reversing effect was observed. With the exception of P-PEG-lauryl ether, this charge-reversal effect decreased with increasing BA concentrations.

Furthermore, the most active compounds (3-O-methyl-butyl-, 3-O-methyl-hexylgallate, and 3-O-methyl-octylgallate) were devoid of cytotoxicity against various human cell lines. Furthermore, 3-O-methyl-butylgallate showed favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) criteria, with a Papp of 6.2 × 10-6 cm/s, and it did not inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp), CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. Whole-genome sequencing of spontaneous resistant mutants indicated that the compounds target the stearoyl-coenzyme A (stearoyl-CoA) delta-9 desaturase DesA3 and thereby inhibit oleic acid synthesis. Supplementation assays demonstrated that oleic acid addition to the culture medium antagonizes the inhibitory properties of gallic acid derivatives and that sodium salts of saturated palmitic and stearic acid did not show compensatory effects. The moderate bactericidal effect of 3-O-methyl-butylgallate in monotreatment was synergistically enhanced in combination treatment with isoniazid, leading to sterilization in liquid culture.",

    "abstract": "Energy is the most limiting nutritional component in diets for high-producing dairy cows. Palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids have unique and specific functions in lactating dairy cows beyond a ubiquitous energy source. This review delineates their metabolism and usage in lactating dairy cows from diet to milk production. Palmitic acid is the fatty acid (FA) found in the greatest quantity in milk fat. Dietary sources of C16:0 generally increase milk fat yield and are used as an energy source for milk production and replenishing body weight loss during periods of negative energy balance. Stearic acid is the most abundant FA available to the dairy cow and is used to a greater extent for milk production and energy balance than C16:0. However, C18:0 is also intimately involved in milk fat production. Quantifying the transfer of each FA from diet into milk fat is complicated by de novo synthesis of C16:0 and desaturation of C18:0 to oleic acid in the mammary gland. In addition, incorporation of both FA into milk fat appears to be limited by the cow's requirement to maintain fluidity of milk, which requires a balance between saturated and unsaturated FA. Oleic acid is the second most abundant FA in milk fat and likely the main unsaturated FA involved in regulating fluidity of milk. Because the mammary gland can desaturate C18:0 to oleic acid, C18:0 appears to have a more prominent role in milk production than C16:0. To understand metabolism and utilization of these FA in lactating dairy cows, we reviewed production and milk fat synthesis studies. Additional and longer lactation studies on feeding both FA to lactating dairy cows are required to better delineate their roles in optimizing milk production and milk FA composition and yield.",

Additionally, we hypothesized that the concentration of SFA would decrease and the concentration of MUFA would increase proportionately with increases in percent intramuscular lipid (%IML). Ten Yanbian Yellow cattle steers (approximately 8 mo of age) were fed a corn-based diet in which the proportion of corn in the ration was increased at 4-mo intervals. Muscle samples were taken by biopsy from the chuck (trapezius), loin (longissimus dorsi), and round (biceps femoris) muscles at 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 mo of age. The %IML increased from 12 to 28 mo of age, especially between 24 and 28 mo of age, with loin > round > chuck (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001). The percentage (g/100 g total fatty acids) of oleic acid (18:1n-9), linoleic acid (18:2n-6), and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), and the MUFA:SFA ratio increased with age, whereas palmitic (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) decreased with age in all muscles (age effect P < 0.001). The expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1), adipose tissue fatty acid- binding protein (FABP4), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increased, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) decreased with age. Expression of PPARγ, FABP4, SREBP1, SCD, FASN, ACC1, and LPL was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001), although the MUFA:SFA ratio was greater in the chuck than in the loin or round (muscle effect P < 0.001). In conclusion, adipogenic gene expression was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round muscles, consistent with the greater %IML of the loin. However, the greater SCD gene expression in the loin did not result in a greater amount of MUFA in the loin, relative to the chuck and round.",

However, high levels of mixed CLA isomers, or the 10,12 isomer, causes chronic inflammation, lipodystrophy, or insulin resistance. We previously demonstrated that 10,12 CLA decreases de novo lipid synthesis along with the abundance and activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1, a δ-9 desaturase essential for the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Thus, we hypothesized that the 10,12 CLA-mediated decrease in SCD-1, with the subsequent decrease in MUFA, was responsible for the observed effects. To test this hypothesis, 10,12 CLA-treated human adipocytes were supplemented with oleic acid for 12 h to 7 days, and inflammatory gene expression, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and lipid content were measured. Oleic acid reduced inflammatory gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, and restored the lipid content of 10,12 CLA-treated adipocytes without improving insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In contrast, supplementation with stearic acid, a substrate for SCD-1, or 9,11 CLA did not prevent inflammatory gene expression by 10,12 CLA. Notably, 10,12 CLA impacted the expression of several G-protein coupled receptors that was attenuated by oleic acid. Collectively, these data show that oleic acid attenuates 10,12 CLA-induced inflammatory gene expression and lipid content, possibly by alleviating cell stress caused by the inhibition of MUFA needed for phospholipid and neutral lipid synthesis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Small for gestational age (SGA) leads to increased risk of adult obesity and metabolic syndrome. Offspring exposed to 50% maternal food restriction in utero are born smaller than Controls (FR), catch-up in growth by the end of the nursing period, and become obese adults. The objective of the study was to determine stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity (SCD1) and rates of de novo fatty acid synthesis in young FR and Control offspring tissues at the end of the nursing period, as possible contributors to catch-up growth.\nMETHODS: From gestational day 10 to term, dams fed ad libitum (Control) or were 50% food-restricted to produce small FR pups. Control dams nursed all pups. At postnatal day 1 (p1) and p21, offspring body tissues were analyzed by GC/MS, and desaturation indices of palmitoleate/palmitate and oleate/stearate were calculated. SCD1 gene expression was determined by real-time PCR on adipose and liver. Offspring were enriched with deuterium that was given to dams in drinking water during lactation and de novo synthesis of offspring body tissues was determined at p21. Primary adipocyte cell cultures were established at p21 and exposed to U(13)C-glucose.\nRESULTS: FR offspring exhibited higher desaturation index in p1 and p21 adipose tissue, but decreased desaturation index in liver at p21. SCD1 gene expression at p21 was correspondingly increased in adipose and decreased in liver. FR subcutaneous fat demonstrated increased de novo synthesis at p21. Primary cell cultures exhibited increased de novo synthesis in FR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adipose tissue is the first site to exhibit increased de novo synthesis and desaturase activity in FR. Therefore, abnormal lipogenesis is already present prior to onset of obesity during the period of catch-up growth. These abnormalities may contribute to future obesity development.",

    "abstract": "In pathogenic filamentous fungi, conidial germination not only is fundamental for propagation in the environment but is also a critical step of infection. In the insect mycopathogen Beauveria bassiana, we genetically characterized the role of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor HapX (BbHapX) in conidial nutrient reserves and pathogen-host interaction. Ablation of BbHapX resulted in an almost complete loss of virulence in the topical inoculation and intrahemocoel injection assays. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that BbHapX is required for fatty acid (FA)/lipid metabolism, and biochemical analyses indicated that BbHapX loss caused a significant reduction in conidial FA contents. Exogenous oleic acid could partially or completely restore the impaired phenotypes of the ΔBbHapX mutant, including germination rate, membrane integrity, vegetative growth, and virulence. BbHapX mediates fungal iron acquisition which is not required for desaturation of stearic acid. Additionally, inactivation of the Δ9-fatty acid desaturase gene (BbOle1) generated defects similar to those of the ΔBbHapX mutant; oleic acid also had significant restorative effects on the defective phenotypes of the ΔBbOle1 mutant. A gel retarding assay revealed that BbHapX directly regulated the expression of BbOle1 Lipidomic analyses indicated that both BbHapX and BbOle1 contributed to the homeostasis of phospholipids with nonpolar tails derived from oleic acid; therefore, exogenous phospholipids could significantly restore membrane integrity. These data reveal that the HapX-Ole1 pathway contributes to conidial fatty acid/lipid reserves and that there are important links between the lipid biology and membrane functionality involved in the early stages of infection caused by B. bassiana IMPORTANCE Conidial maturation and germination are highly coupled physiological processes in filamentous fungi that are critical for the pathogenicity of mycopathogens. Compared to the mechanisms involved in conidial germination, those of conidial reserves during maturation are less understood. The insect-pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, as a representative species of filamentous fungi, is important for applied and fundamental research. In addition to its conserved roles in fungal adaptation to iron status, the bZIP transcription factor HapX acts as a master regulator involved in conidial virulence and regulates fatty acid/lipid metabolism. Further investigation revealed that the Δ9-fatty acid desaturase gene (Ole1) is a direct downstream target of HapX. This study reveals the HapX-Ole1 pathway involved in the fatty acid/lipid accumulation associated with conidial maturation and provides new insights into the startup mechanism of infection caused by spores from pathogenic fungi.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lipids are a class of molecules that play an important role in cellular structure and metabolism in all cell types. In the last few decades, it has been reported that long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are involved in several biological functions from transcriptional regulation to physiological processes. Several fatty acids have been both positively and negatively implicated in different biological processes in skeletal muscle and other tissues. To gain insight into biological processes associated with fatty acid content in skeletal muscle, the aim of the present study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and functional pathways related to gene expression regulation associated with FA content in cattle.\nRESULTS: Skeletal muscle transcriptome analysis of 164 Nellore steers revealed no differentially expressed genes (DEGs, FDR 10%) for samples with extreme values for linoleic acid (LA) or stearic acid (SA), and only a few DEGs for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 5 DEGs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 4 DEGs) and palmitic acid (PA, 123 DEGs), while large numbers of DEGs were associated with oleic acid (OA, 1134 DEGs) and conjugated linoleic acid cis9 trans11 (CLA-c9t11, 872 DEGs). Functional annotation and functional enrichment from OA DEGs identified important genes, canonical pathways and upstream regulators such as SCD, PLIN5, UCP3, CPT1, CPT1B, oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial dysfunction, PPARGC1A, and FOXO1. Two important genes associated with lipid metabolism, gene expression and cancer were identified as DEGs between animals with high and low CLA-c9t11, specifically, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and RNPS.\nCONCLUSION: Only two out of seven classes of molecules of FA studied were associated with large changes in the expression profile of skeletal muscle. OA and CLA-c9t11 content had significant effects on the expression level of genes related to important biological processes associated with oxidative phosphorylation, and cell growth, survival, and migration. These results contribute to our understanding of how some FAs modulate metabolism and may have protective health function.",

Total adipocyte fractions could be separated into the small-cell fraction (SCF) and the large-cell fraction (LCF). Adipocytokine expression, fatty acid composition and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) expression were compared between SCF and LCF.\nRESULTS: In HFD mice, body weight, glucose and cholesterol levels were significantly higher than in NCD mice. The adipocyte diameter of HFD mice continuously increased throughout the feeding period regardless of the fat depot. The expression of adipocytokine genes such as angiotensinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, adipsin, leptin, TNF-alpha and adiponectin was higher in LCF than SCF. The ratio of stearic acid to the total fatty acid content was lower in SCF than LCF, whereas oleic acid composition was higher in LCF. SCD expression was higher in LCF than SCF.\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that large adipocytes strongly express adipocytokine genes and show high oleic acid composition via SCD upregulation.

    "abstract": "Unsaturated fatty acids are important constituents of all cell membranes and are required for normal growth. In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives also influence asexual (conidial) and sexual (ascospore) sporulation processes. To investigate the relationship between fatty acid metabolism and fungal development, we disrupted the A. nidulans sdeA and sdeB genes, both encoding Delta9-stearic acid desaturases responsible for the conversion of palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) to palmitoleic acid (16:1) and oleic acid (18:1). The effects of sdeA deletion on development were profound, such that growth, conidial and ascospore production were all reduced at 22 and 37 degrees C. Total fatty acid content was increased over 3-fold in the DeltasdeA strain, reflected in up-regulation of the expression of the fasA gene encoding the alpha chain of the fatty acid synthase, compared to wild type. Stearic acid accumulated approximately 3-fold compared to wild type in the DeltasdeA strain, while unsaturated fatty acid production was decreased. In contrast, disruption of sdeB reduced fungal growth and conidiation at 22 degrees C, but did not affect these processes at 37 degrees C compared to wild type. Interestingly, ascospore production was increased at 37 degrees C for DeltasdeB compared to wild type. Total fatty acid content was not increased in this strain, although stearic acid accumulated 2-fold compared to wild type, and unsaturated fatty acid production was decreased. Combining the DeltasdeA and DeltasdeB alleles created a synthetic lethal strain requiring the addition of oleic acid to the medium for a modicum of growth. Taken together, our results suggest a role for sdeA in growth and development at all temperatures, while sdeB is involved in growth and development at lower temperatures.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we explored the relationship between agronomic characteristics and fatty acid composition in perilla germplasm and examined the potential effects of genetic variations in the FAD3 gene on these traits. Our analysis involved correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and path analysis. We discovered the days to flowering (DTF), days to maturing (DTM) number of branches (NB), and stearic acid (SA) content were positively correlated with each other. Conversely, oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) showed negative correlations among themselves. We observed significant differences in agronomic traits and fatty acid composition based on the color of the perilla seed hull, indicating the influence of genetic factors on these traits. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation at the 182 bp position in the FAD3 gene, characterized by a homozygous G base, was significantly associated with a decrease in LA proportion. This is in line with the known biochemical role of FAD3 in fatty acid desaturation. Interestingly, this SNP was also correlated with an increase in NB, suggesting that FAD3 may have pleiotropic effects on both agronomic traits and fatty acid composition. However, SNPs at the 596 bp and 599 bp positions in the FAD3 gene did not show clear patterns, suggesting potential influences from other genetic or environmental factors. These findings offer valuable insights into the genetic and phenotypic interactions in perilla, highlighting the importance of FAD3 variation. This knowledge can aid in the development of targeted breeding and selection strategies for perilla cultivars, optimizing both agronomic performance and nutritional quality. Further research is required to clarify the precise mechanisms of FAD3 and its impact on perilla traits.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the fungal metabolism of nC10 and nC11 fatty acids and their conversion into lipids. A mixed batch culture of soil fungi, T. koningii and P. janthinellum, was grown on undecanoic acid (UDA), a mixture of UDA and potato dextrose broth (UDA+PDB), and PDB alone to examine their metabolic conversion during growth. We quantified seven intracellular and extracellular lipid classes using Iatroscan thin-layer chromatography with flame ionization detection (TLC-FID). Gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) was used to quantify 42 individual fatty acids. Per 150 mL culture, the mixed fungal culture grown on UDA+PDB produced the highest amount of intracellular (531 mg) and extracellular (14.7 mg) lipids during the exponential phase. The content of total intracellular lipids represented 25% of the total biomass-carbon, or 10% of the total biomass dry weight produced. Fatty acids made up the largest class of intracellular lipids (457 mg/150 mL culture) and they were synthesized at a rate of 2.4 mg/h during the exponential phase, and decomposed at a rate of 1.8 mg/h during the stationary phase, when UDA+PDB was the carbon source. Palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2) and vaccenic acid (C18:1) accounted for >80% of the total intracellular fatty acids. During exponential growth on UDA+PDB, hydrocarbons were the largest pool of all extracellular lipids (6.5 mg), and intracellularly they were synthesized at a rate of 64 μg/h. The mixed fungal species culture of T. koningii and P. janthinellum produced many lipids for potential use as industrial feedstocks or bioproducts in biorefineries.",

So far, studies on germline-longevity signaling have focused on daf-16/FOXO and daf-12/VDR. Here, we report on NHR-80/HNF4, a nuclear receptor that specifically mediates longevity induced by depletion of the germ line through a mechanism that implicates fatty acid monodesaturation.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: nhr-80/HNF4 is induced in animals lacking a germ line and is specifically required for their extended longevity. Overexpressing nhr-80/HNF4 increases the lifespan of germline-less animals. This lifespan extension can occur in the absence of daf-16/FOXO but requires the presence of the nuclear receptor DAF-12/VDR. We show that the fatty acid desaturase, FAT-6/SCD1, is a key target of NHR-80/HNF4 and promotes germline-longevity by desaturating stearic acid to oleic acid (OA). We find that NHR-80/HNF4 and OA must work in concert to promote longevity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data indicate that the NHR-80 pathway participates in the mechanism of longevity extension through depletion of the germ line. We identify fat-6 and OA as essential downstream elements although other targets must also be present. Thus, NHR-80 links fatty acid desaturation to lifespan extension through germline ablation in a daf-16/FOXO independent manner.",

One of the most abundant components of the porcine follicular fluid are fatty acids (FAs). Although evidence from other mammalian models revealed a negative impact of saturated fatty acids (SFA) on developmental competence of oocytes, pig has not yet been widely analyzed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether supplementation of IVM medium with 150 μM of stearic acid (SA) and oleic acid (OA) affects lipid content and expression of genes related to fatty acid metabolism in porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes and parthenogenetic embryo development. We found significant influence of fatty acids on lipid metabolism in cumulus cells without affecting the oocyte proper. The expression of ACACA, SCD, PLIN2, FADS1, and FADS2 genes was upregulated (P < 0.01) in cumulus cells, while their expression in oocytes did not change. The increase in gene expression was more pronounced in the case of OA (e.g., up to 30-fold increase in PLIN2 transcript level compared to the control). The number of lipid droplets and occupied area increased significantly in the cumulus cells and did not change in oocytes after SA treatment. Oleic acid improved the blastocyst rate (48 vs 32% in control), whereas stearic acid did not affect this parameter (27%). Additionally, we have discovered a phenotypic diversity of LD in cumulus cells in response to FA supplementation, suggesting extensive lipolysis in response to SA.

    "abstract": "The expression of desaturases is higher in many types of cancer, and despite their recognized role in oncogenesis, there has been no research on the expression of desaturases in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Tumor tissue samples were collected during surgery from 28 patients (16 men and 12 women) diagnosed with GBM. The effect of necrotic conditions and nutritional deficiency (mimicking conditions in the studied tumor zones) was studied in an in vitro culture of human brain (glioblastoma astrocytoma) U-87 MG cells. Analysis of desaturase expression was made by qRT-PCR and the immunohistochemistry method. In the tumor, the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) and fatty acid desaturases 2 (FADS2) was lower than in the peritumoral area.

Gallium is a group IIIa metal that is redox inactive, however, its atomic similarity to iron allows it to serve as an iron mimic that may disrupt Fe metabolism. The current understanding of its mechanism of action is related to its ability to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase and the electron transport chain, however, its effects on other iron-dependent metabolic processes (e.g., lipid metabolism) are unknown. Ferroptosis is a unique iron-dependent form of cell death, thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of Ga(NO3)3 on the induction of ferroptosis. Despite its redox inactivity, Ga(NO3)3 promotes the formation of oxidized lipid droplets. Moreover, Ga(NO3)3 enhances the toxicity of the ferroptosis inducer, erastin, and decreases cell stiffness, indicating an exacerbation of ferroptosis. Ga(NO3)3 also enhances the toxicity of the stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibition, and its toxicity can be reversed by oleic acid supplementation, suggesting that Ga(NO3)3 can potentially inhibit SCD. Lipidomic analysis revealed a significant increase in oxidizable triglycerides following Ga(NO3)3 treatment. Thus, it appears that Ga(NO3)3 exacerbates ferroptosis in glioblastoma cells by disrupting the di-ferric lipid metabolic regulator SCD and warrants further investigation as an alternate mechanism of action for Ga-based therapy.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapy agent for glioblastoma (GBM), poses a major clinical challenge to GBM prognosis. Understanding the mechanisms of TMZ resistance can help to identify novel drug targets and more effective therapies. Recent studies suggest that bioenergetic alterations of cancer cells play important roles in drug resistance. In our study, the altered metabolism of cancer cells was observed using a metabolic PCR array. We found that stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), a key rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, was significantly upregulated in TMZ-resistant GBM cells compared to their parental counterparts. Overexpression of SCD1 promoted resistance to TMZ in parental GBM cells, whereas SCD1 downregulation by siRNA could re-sensitize TMZ-resistant cells in vitro. Combinational treatment of TMZ and an SCD1-specific inhibitor showed a combined inhibitory effect on TMZ-resistant glioma cells. We also observed that overexpression of SCD1 promoted Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling, while silencing of SCD1 inhibited the signaling. The combination of an Akt activator with exogenous SCD1 or the combined inhibition of Akt and enforced expression of SCD1 resulted in the most significant changes of Akt signaling. Functionally, significantly lower viability and mobility rates were observed in TMZ-resistant cells when treated with Akt inhibitors and an SCD1 inhibitor simultaneously compared to when treated individually. In conclusion, our study identified SCD1 along with its functional pathway as a novel target in the development of TMZ resistance. SCD1 inhibition used alone or in combination with Akt inhibition could effectively overcome TMZ resistance in gliomas.",

Hypoxia following MI is a major driver of angiogenesis in the myocardium. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) is the key regulator of proangiogenic signaling. The present study found that stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) significantly contributed to the induction of angiogenesis in the hypoxic myocardium independently of HIF1α expression. The pharmacological inhibition of SCD activity in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and SCD knockout in an animal model disturbed the expression and secretion of proangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor-A, proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and Rantes), metalloproteinase-9, and platelet-derived growth factor in ischemic cardiomyocytes. These disturbances affected the proangiogenic potential of ischemic cardiomyocytes after SCD depletion. Together with the most abundant SCD1 isoform, the heart-specific SCD4 isoform emerged as an important regulator of new blood vessel formation in the murine post-MI myocardium. We also provide evidence that SCD shapes energy metabolism of the ischemic heart by maintaining the shift from fatty acids to glucose as the substrate that is used for adenosine triphosphate production. Furthermore, we propose that the regulation of the proangiogenic properties of hypoxic cardiomyocytes by key modulators of metabolic signaling such as adenosine monophosphate kinase, protein kinase B (AKT), and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α depends on SCD to some extent.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic pathology, leading to acute coronary heart disease or stroke. MiR-127 has been found significantly upregulated in advanced atherosclerosis. But its function in atherosclerosis remains unexplored. We explored the role of miR-127-3p in regulating atherosclerosis development and its downstream mechanisms.\nMETHODS: The expression profile of miR-127 in carotid atherosclerotic plaques of 23 patients with severe carotid stenosis was detected by RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein were used as an in vitro model. CCK-8, EdU, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry were used to detect the proliferative capacity and polarization of BMDM, which were infected by lentivirus-carrying plasmid to upregulate or downregulate miR-127-3p expression, respectively. RNA sequencing combined with bioinformatic analysis and targeted fatty acid metabolomics approach were used to detect the transcriptome and lipid metabolites. The association between miR-127-3p and its target was verified by dual-luciferase activity reporting and Western blotting. Oxygen consumption rate of BMDM were detected using seahorse analysis. High-cholesterol-diet-fed low density lipoprotein deficient (LDLR-/-) mice, with-or-without carotid tandem-stenosis surgery, were treated with miR-127-3p agomir or antagomir to examine its effect on plaque development and stability.\nRESULTS: miR-127-3p, not -5p, is elevated in human advanced carotid atheroma and its expression is positively associated with macrophage accummulation in plaques. In vitro, miR-127-3p-overexpressed macrophage exhibites increased proliferation capacity and facilitates M1 polariztion whereas the contrary trend is present in miR-127-3p-inhibited macrophage. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) is one potential target of miR-127-3p. miR-127-3p mimics decreases the activity of 3' untranslated regions of SCD-1. Furthermore, miR-127-3p downregulates SCD1 expression, and reversing the expression of SCD1 attenuates the increased proliferation induced by miR-127-3p overexpression in macrophage. miR-127-3p overexpression could also lead to decreased content of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), increased content of acetyl CoA and increased level of oxidative phosphorylation. In vivo, miR-127-3p agomir significantly increases atherosclerosis progression, macrophage proliferation and decreases SCD1 expression and the content of UFAs in aortic plaques of LDLR-/- mice. Conversely, miR-127-3p antagomir attenuated atherosclerosis, macrophage proliferation in LDLR-/- mice, and enhanced carotid plaque stability in mice with vulnerable plaque induced.\nCONCLUSION: MiR-127-3p enhances proliferation in macrophages through downregulating SCD-1 expression and decreasing the content of unsaturated fatty acid, thereby promoting atherosclerosis development and decreasing plaque stability. miR-127-3p/SCD1/UFAs might provide potential therapeutic target for anti-inflammation and atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a cause of acute coronary syndromes and in rare cases sudden cardiac death (SCD). Connective tissue abnormalities, coronary inflammation, increased coronary vasa vasorum (VV) density, and coronary fibromuscular dysplasia have all been implicated in the pathophysiology of SCAD but have not previously been systematically assessed. We designed a study to investigate the coronary histological and dermal collagen ultrastructural findings in SCAD.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-six autopsy SCAD cases were compared with 359 SCAD survivors. Coronary and myocardial histology and immunohistochemistry were undertaken. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) components of n = 31 SCAD survivors and n = 16 healthy volunteers were compared. Autopsy cases were more likely male (19% vs. 5%; P = 0.0004) with greater proximal left coronary involvement (56% vs. 18%; P < 0.0001) compared to SCAD survivors. N = 24 (66%) of cases showed no myocardial infarction on macro- or microscopic examination consistent with arrhythmogenic death. There was significantly (P < 0.001) higher inflammation in cases with delayed-onset death vs. sudden death and significantly more inflammation surrounding the dissected vs. non-dissected vessel segments. N = 17 (47%) cases showed limited intimal fibro-elastic thickening but no features of fibromuscular dysplasia and no endothelial or internal elastic lamina abnormalities. There were no differences in VV density between SCAD and control cases. TEM revealed no general ultrastructural differences in ECM components or markers of fibroblast metabolic activity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Assessment of SCD requires careful exclusion of SCAD, particularly in cases without myocardial necrosis. Peri-coronary inflammation in SCAD is distinct from vasculitides and likely a reaction to, rather than a cause for SCAD. Coronary fibromuscular dysplasia or increased VV density does not appear pathophysiologically important. Dermal connective tissue changes are not common in SCAD survivors.",

    "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are the most abundant cell type in the artery's media layer and regulate vascular tone and lesion remodeling during atherogenesis. Like monocyte-derived macrophages, VSMCs accumulate excess lipids and contribute to the total intimal foam cell population in human coronary plaques and mouse aortic atheroma. While there are extensive studies characterizing the contribution of lipid metabolism in macrophage immunometabolic responses in atherosclerotic plaques, the role of VSMC lipid metabolism in regulating vascular function and lesion remodeling in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway in VSMC is continuously activated during atherogenesis. Notably, we found that LXR deficiency in SMCs under hypercholesterolemic conditions influenced lesion remodeling by altering the fate of dedifferentiated SMCs and promoting the accumulation of VSMC-derived transitional cells. This phenotypic switching was accompanied by reduced indices of plaque stability, characterized by a larger necrotic core area and reduced fibrous cap thickness. Moreover, SMC-specific LXR deficiency impaired vascular function and caused visceral myopathy characterized by maladaptive bladder remodeling and gut lipid malabsorption. Mechanistically, we found that the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol efflux and FA synthesis including Abca1, Srebf1, Scd1, Scd2, Acsl3, and Mid1ip1 was downregulated in mice lacking LXRαβ in SMCs, likely contributing to the phenotypic switching of VSMC in the atherosclerotic lesions.",

However, the pathways by which dysregulation of lipid and mineral metabolism simultaneously occur in this particular population remain unclear. We have shown that activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) blocks mineralization of bovine calcifying vascular cells (CVCs) and in ApoE knock-out mice with 5/6 nephrectomy. In contrast to FXR, this study showed that liver X receptor (LXR) activation by LXR agonists and adenovirus-mediated LXR overexpression by VP16-LXRα and VP16-LXRβ accelerated mineralization of CVCs. Conversely, LXR inhibition by dominant negative (DN) forms of LXRα and LXRβ reduced calcium content in CVCs. The regulation of mineralization by FXR and LXR agonists was highly correlated with changes in lipid accumulation, fatty acid synthesis, and the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). The rate of lipogenesis in CVCs through the SREBP-1c dependent pathway was reduced by FXR activation, but increased by LXR activation. SREBP-1c overexpression augmented mineralization in CVCs, whereas SREBP-1c DN inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization induced by LXR agonists. LXR and SREBP-1c activations increased, whereas FXR activation decreased, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids derived from lipogenesis. In addition, we found that stearate markedly promoted mineralization of CVCs as compared with other fatty acids. Furthermore, inhibition of either acetyl-CoA carboxylase or acyl-CoA synthetase reduced mineralization of CVCs, whereas inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase induced mineralization. Therefore, a stearate metabolite derived from lipogenesis might be a risk factor for the development of vascular calcification.",

Trans fatty acids might play their atherogenic effects through lipid metabolism alteration of vascular cells. Accumulation of lipids in vascular smooth muscle cells is a feature of atherosclerosis and a consequence of lipid metabolism alteration. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (scd1) catalyses the production of monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g. oleic acid) and its expression is associated with lipogenesis induction and with atherosclerosis development. We were interested in analysing the regulation of delta-9 desaturation rate and scd1 expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) exposed to cis and trans C18:1 fatty acid isomers (cis-9 oleic acid, trans-11 vaccenic acid or trans-9 elaidic acid) for 48 h at 100 μM. Treatment of HASMC with these C18:1 fatty acid isomers led to differential effects on delta-9 desaturation; oleic acid repressed the desaturation rate more potently than trans-11 vaccenic acid, whereas trans-9 elaidic acid increased the delta-9 desaturation rate. We then correlated the delta-9 desaturation rate with the expression of scd1 protein and mRNA. We showed that C18:1 fatty acids controlled the expression of scd1 at the transcriptional level in HASMC, leading to an increase in scd1 mRNA content by trans-9 elaidic acid treatment, whereas a decrease in scd1 mRNA content was observed with cis-9 oleic acid and trans-11 vaccenic acid treatments. Altogether, this work highlights a differential capability of C18:1 fatty acid isomers to control scd1 gene expression, which presumes of different consequent effects on cell functions.",

Transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets of OSAHS mouse models were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes and metabolites, followed by functional enrichment analysis. Key genes were screened using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning, and a PPI network was constructed. An OSAHS mouse model was developed via intermittent hypoxia exposure. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation cycles to simulate OSAHS in vitro. Blood pressure, plasma lipid profiles, histological changes in the thoracic aorta, and Scd1 protein expression were assessed. CCK-8 and Transwell assays evaluated HASMC proliferation and migration. Scd1 was identified as a critical factor in OSAHS-related vascular remodeling, with its expression significantly upregulated in vascular tissues of OSAHS mice. Metabolomic analysis revealed changes in fatty acid metabolism. Scd1 knockdown reduced blood pressure, lipid levels, aortic wall thickness, collagen deposition, elastic fiber accumulation, and mucin deposition in vivo. In vitro, hypoxia/reoxygenation cycles elevated Scd1 expression, while Scd1 knockdown inhibited HASMC proliferation and migration. Multi-omics analyses highlight Scd1 as a key regulator in OSAHS-associated vascular remodeling, driving pathological changes through its upregulation.

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) can differentiate into cardiomyocytes (CM) and represent a promising form of cellular therapy for heart regeneration. However, residual undifferentiated iPS derivates (iPSD), which are not fully eliminated by cell differentiation or purification protocols, may form tumors after transplantation, thus compromising therapeutic application. Inhibition of stearoyl-coA desaturase (SCD) has recently been reported to eliminate undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells, which share many features with iPSD. Here, we tested the effects of PluriSin#1, a small-molecule inhibitor of SCD, on iPS-derived CM. We found that plurisin#1 treatment significantly decreased the mRNA and protein level of Nanog, a marker for both cell pluripotency and tumor progression; importantly, we provide evidence that PluriSin#1 treatment at 20 µM for 1 day significantly induces the apoptosis of Nanog-positive iPSD. In addition, PluriSin#1 treatment at 20 µM for 4 days diminished Nanog-positive stem cells in cultured iPSD while not increasing apoptosis of iPS-derived CM. To investigate whether PluriSin#1 treatment prevents tumorigenicity of iPSD after cell transplantation, we intramyocardially injected PluriSin#1- or DMSO-treated iPSD in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI). DMSO-treated iPSD readily formed Nanog-expressing tumors 2 weeks after injection, which was prevented by treatment with PluriSin#1. Moreover, treatment with PluriSin#1 did not change the expression of cTnI, α-MHC, or MLC-2v, markers of cardiac differentiation (P>0.05, n = 4). Importantly, pluriSin#1-treated iPS-derived CM exhibited the ability to engraft and survive in the infarcted myocardium. We conclude that inhibition of SCD holds the potential to enhance the safety of therapeutic application of iPS cells for heart regeneration.",

Yaks can adapt to the hypoxic plateau environment and also pass this adaptability on to the next generation. The lungs are the most important respiratory organs for mammals to adapt to their environment. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells play an important role in vascular remodeling under hypoxia, but the genetic mechanism underpinning the yak's ability to adapt to challenging plateau conditions is still unknown.\nMETHODS: A tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics study together with an RNA-seq transcriptome analysis were carried out on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) that had been grown for 72 hours in both normoxic (20% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) environments. RNA and TP (total protein) were collected from the hypoxic and normoxic groups for RNA-seq transcriptome sequencing and TMT marker protein quantification, and RT-qPCR validation was performed.\nRESULTS: A total of 17,711 genes and 6,859 proteins were identified. Further, 5,969 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 531 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the comparison group, including 2,924 and 186 upregulated genes and proteins and 3,045 and 345 down-regulated genes and proteins, respectively. The transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that 109 DEGs and DEPs were highly positively correlated, with 77 genes showing the same expression trend. Nine overlapping genes were identified in the HIF-1 signaling pathway, glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, central carbon metabolism in cancer, PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, and cholesterol metabolism (PGAM1, PGK1, TPI1, HMOX1, IGF1R, OLR1, SCD, FABP4 and LDLR), suggesting that these differentially expressed genes and protein functional classifications are related to the hypoxia-adaptive pathways. Overall, our study offers abundant data for further analysis of the molecular mechanisms in yak PASMCs and their adaptability to different oxygen concentrations.",

High PVC burden can lead to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, eccentric hypertrophy, and an increased risk of heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Inadequate angiogenesis is a key determinant in the transition from adaptive to maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis is a risk factor for arrhythmia and SCD. To quantitatively assess structural remodeling and transcriptional alterations in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM), animals were implanted with modified pacemakers to deliver bigeminal PVCs (200-220 ms coupling interval) for 12 weeks. Collagen deposition and interstitial ultrastructure of LV samples were analyzed using light and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Pericytes, fibroblasts, myocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells were imaged using confocal microscopy, quantified with an artificial intelligence-based segmentation analysis, and compared using hierarchical statistics. Transcriptional changes were assessed via RNAseq. Although cardiomyocytes hypertrophied in PVC-CM, capillary rarefaction was overcome by an increase in capillary-to-myocyte ratio. Additionally, thicker blood vessels were more abundant in PVC-CM. Fibroblast-to-myocyte ratio more than doubled, interstitial collagen fibers increased, and interstitial space thickened in PVC-CM. Transcripts involved in interstitial remodeling, inflammatory response, and alarmins were strongly elevated in PVC-CM. Overall, while the angiogenic response meets the metabolic demands of cardiac hypertrophy, upregulated markers of inflammation and cardiomyopathy linked to reactive fibrosis collectively represent an adverse LV remodeling that heightens the risk of HF and SCD in PVC-CM.",

Our study thus aimed to evaluate the status of tumor dedifferentiation for HCC and further identify the regulatory mechanisms under the condition of resistance to sorafenib. Datasets of HCC, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression, somatic mutation, and clinical information were collected. The mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi), which can represent degrees of dedifferentiation of HCC samples, was calculated to predict drug response of sorafenib therapy and prognosis. Next, unsupervised cluster analysis was conducted to distinguish mRNAsi-based subgroups, and gene/geneset functional enrichment analysis was employed to identify key sorafenib resistance-related pathways. In addition, we analyzed and confirmed the regulation of key genes discovered in this study by combining other omics data. Finally, Luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate their regulation. Our study demonstrated that the stemness index obtained from transcriptomic is a promising biomarker to predict the response of sorafenib therapy and the prognosis in HCC. We revealed the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway (the PPAR signaling pathway), related to fatty acid biosynthesis, that was a potential sorafenib resistance pathway that had not been reported before. By analyzing the core regulatory genes of the PPAR signaling pathway, we identified four candidate target genes, retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB), nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3 (NR1H3), cytochrome P450 family 8 subfamily B member 1 (CYP8B1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), as a signature to distinguish the response of sorafenib. We proposed and validated that the RXRB and NR1H3 could directly regulate NR1H3 and SCD, respectively. Our results suggest that the combined use of SCD inhibitors and sorafenib may be a promising therapeutic approach.",

Lipoprotein-associated PEth affects endothelial and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, but its effects on other cell types have not been explored. Adipocytes have a central role in metabolic syndrome and obesity. In this study we tested whether lipoprotein-associated PEth affects stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) which plays a major role in lipid-mediated signaling in the differentiation of adipocytes.\nMETHODS: Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated to adipocytes in the presence of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) isolated from the plasma of healthy volunteers or PEth-containing HDL modified in vitro. After incubation, fat accumulation, SCD1 mRNA expression, SCD1 protein content, and fatty acid composition of adipocytes were determined.\nRESULTS: Phosphatidylethanol-containing HDL particles inhibited adipocyte differentiation and decreased the 18:1/18:0 ratio of cellular fatty acids by 28% compared with native HDL particles.

Increased expression during adipogenesis suggests a role of Cyp1b1 metabolism in fatty acid homeostasis. Wild-type C57BL/6j (WT) and Cyp1b1-null (Cyp1b1-ko) mice were provided low or high fat diets (LFD and HFD, respectively). Cyp1b1-deletion suppressed HFD-induced obesity, improved glucose tolerance and prevented liver steatosis. Suppression of lipid droplets in sinusoidal hepatocytes, concomitant with enhanced glycogen granules, was a consistent feature of Cyp1b1-ko mice.

This study aims to explore the effect of a previously unreported mutation c.C2473T (p.R825S) in the C-terminal transactivation domain (CTAD) of HIF-2α that we detected in tissue of patients with liver disease. We sequenced available liver and matched blood samples obtained during partial liver resection or liver transplantation performed for clinical indications including hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. In tandem, we constructed cell lines and a transgenic mouse model bearing the corresponding identified mutation in HIF-2α from which we extracted primary hepatocytes. Lipid accumulation was evaluated in these cells and liver tissue from the mouse model using Oil Red O staining and biochemical measurements. We identified a mutation in the CTAD of HIF-2α (c.C2473T; p.R825S) in 5 of 356 liver samples obtained from patients with hepatopathy and dyslipidemia. We found that introduction of this mutation into the mouse model led to an elevated triglyceride level, lipid droplet accumulation in liver of the mutant mice and in their extracted primary hepatocytes, and increased transcription of genes related to hepatic fatty acid transport and synthesis in the mutant compared to the control groups. In mutant mice and cells, the protein levels of nuclear HIF-2α and its target perilipin-2 (PLIN2), a lipid droplet-related gene, were also elevated. Decreased lipophagy was observed in mutant groups. Our study defines a subpopulation of dyslipidemia that is caused by this HIF-2α mutation. This may have implications for personalized treatment.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal microbiota has been associated with host immunity as well as psoriasis; however, the mechanism of intestinal microbiota regulating psoriasis needs to be demonstrated systematically. Here, we sought to examine its role and mechanism of action in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We found that the severity of psoriasis-like skin phenotype was accompanied by changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. We performed co-housing and fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) experiments using the K14-VEGF transgenic mouse model of psoriasis and demonstrated that the transfer of intestinal microbiota from mice with severe psoriasis-like skin phenotype exacerbated psoriasiform skin inflammation in mice with mild symptoms, including increasing the infiltration and differentiation of Th17, and increased the abundance of Prevotella, while decreasing that of Parabacteroides distasonis, in the colon. These alterations affected fatty acid metabolism, increasing the abundance of oleic and stearic acids. Meanwhile, gentamicin treatment significantly reduced the abundance of Prevotella and alleviated the psoriasis-like symptoms in both K14-VEGF mice and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like mice. Indeed, administration of oleic and stearic acids exacerbated psoriasis-like symptoms and increased Th17 and monocyte-derived dendritic cell infiltration in the skin lesion areas in vivo, as well as increased the secretion of IL-23 by stimulating DCs in vitro. At last, we found that, treatment of PDE-4 inhibitor alleviated psoriasis-like phenotype of K14-VEGF mice accompanied by the recovery of intestinal microbiota, including the decrease of Prevotella and increase of Parabacteroides distasonis. Overall, our findings reveal that the intestinal microbiota modulates host metabolism and psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice, suggesting a new target for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue engraftment has become a promising strategy in the field of regenerative surgery; however, there are notable challenges associated with it, such as resorption of 50‑90% of the transplanted fat or cyst formation due to fat necrosis after fat transplantation. Therefore, identifying novel materials or methods to improve the engraftment efficiency is crucial. The present study investigated the effects of nervonic acid (NA), a monounsaturated very long‑chain fatty acid, on adipogenesis and fat transplantation, as well as its underlying mechanisms. To assess this, NA was used to treat cells during adipogenesis in vitro, and the expression levels of markers, including PPARγ and CEBPα, and signaling molecules were detected through reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting. In addition, NA was mixed with fat grafts in in vivo fat transplantation, followed by analysis through Oil Red O staining, hematoxylin & eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. It was demonstrated that NA treatment accelerated adipogenesis through activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway and inhibition of Wnt signaling. NA treatment enriched the expression of Akt/mTOR signaling‑related genes, and increased the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and fat differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Additionally, NA effectively improved the outcome of adipose tissue engraftment in mice. Treatment of grafts with NA at transplantation reduced the resorption of transplanted fat and increased the proportion of perilipin‑1+ adipocytes with a lower portion of vacuoles in mice. Moreover, the NA‑treated group exhibited a reduced pro‑inflammatory response and had more CD31+ vessel structures, which were relatively evenly distributed among viable adipocytes, facilitating successful engraftment. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that NA may not only stimulate adipogenesis by regulating signaling pathways in human MSCs, but could improve the outcome of fat transplantation by reducing inflammation and stimulating angiogenesis. It was thus hypothesized that NA could serve as an adjuvant strategy to enhance fat engraftment in regenerative surgery.",

Chemotherapy combined with anti-vascular therapy has emerged as the standard treatment, but resistance to anti-VEGFA therapy inevitably develops.

We identified lipid-rich and fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-activated proliferating TECs in fatty colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) that mediate resistance to anti-VEGFA treatment. The TEC-specific F3 protein inhibited the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway through the MAPK/JNK-MAPK/ERK-TP53/p53 signaling axis, thereby prevented CPT1A protein degradation and enhanced FAO. F3 was also involved in promoting lipid uptake and lipophagy. This process promoted cellular FAO under conditions of fatty acids and anti-VEGFA stimulation. Targeting FAO proved effective in overcoming resistance to anti-VEGFA treatment.

    "abstract": "N-Nitrosamine disinfection by-products (NAs-DBPs) have been well proven for its role in esophageal carcinogenesis. However, the role of intratumoral microorganisms in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not yet been well explored in the context of exposure to NAs-DBPs. Here, the multi-omics integration reveals F. periodonticum (Fp) as \"facilitators\" is highly enriched in cancer tissues and promotes the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like subtype formation of ESCC. We demonstrate that Fp potently drives de novo synthesis of fatty acids, migration, invasion and EMT phenotype through its unique FadAL adhesin. However, N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine upregulates the transcription level of FadAL. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry shows that FadAL interacts with FLOT1. Furthermore, FLOT1 activates PI3K-AKT/FASN signaling pathway, leading to triglyceride and palmitic acid (PA) accumulation. Innovatively, the results from the acyl-biotin exchange demonstrate that FadAL-mediated PA accumulation enhances Wnt3A palmitoylation on a conserved cysteine residue, Cys-77, and promotes Wnt3A membrane localization and the translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus, further activating Wnt3A/β-catenin axis and inducing EMT phenotype. We therefore propose a \"microbiota-cancer cell subpopulation\" interaction model in the highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. This study unveils a mechanism by which Fp can drive ESCC and identifies FadAL as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for ESCC.",

    "abstract": "Chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) is associated with obesity and is one of its pathogenetic mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, is the principal cause of CLGI. Studies have found that capsaicin significantly reduces the relative abundance of LPS-producing bacteria. In the present study, TRPV1-knockout (TRPV1-/-) C57BL/6J mice and the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 (TRPV1-/-) were used as models to determine the effect of capsaicin on CLGI and elucidate the mechanism by which it mediates weight loss in vivo and in vitro. We found that the intragastric administration of capsaicin significantly blunted increases in body weight, food intake, blood lipid, and blood glucose in TRPV1-/- mice fed a high-fat diet, suggesting an anti-obesity effect of capsaicin. Capsaicin reduced LPS levels in the intestine by reducing the relative abundance of Proteobacteria such as Helicobacter, Desulfovibrio, and Sutterella. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) levels decreased following decreases in LPS levels. Then, the local inflammation of the intestine was reduced by reducing the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 mediated by TLR4. Attenuating local intestinal inflammation led to the increased expression of tight junction proteins zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and occludin and the restoration of the intestinal barrier function. Capsaicin increased the expression of ZO-1 and occludin at the transcriptional and translational levels, thereby increasing trans-endothelial electrical resistance and restoring intestinal barrier function. The restoration of intestinal barrier function decreases intestinal permeability, which reduces the concentration of LPS entering the circulation, and reduced endotoxemia leads to decreased serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, thereby attenuating CLGI. This study sheds light on the anti-obesity effect of capsaicin and its mechanism by reducing CLGI, increasing our understanding of the anti-obesity effects of capsaicin. It has been confirmed that capsaicin can stimulate the expression of intestinal transmembrane protein ZO-1 and cytoplasmic protein occludin, increase the trans-epithelial electrical resistance value, and repair intestinal barrier function.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antiangiogenic drug (AAD)-triggered oxygen and nutrient depletion through suppression of angiogenesis switches glucose-dependent to lipid-dependent metabolism. Blocking fatty acid oxidation can enhance AAD-mediated anti-tumor effects in colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, we hypothesised that genetic variants in the lipid metabolism pathway may predict clinical outcomes [overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)] in metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients receiving bevacizumab-based first-line treatment.\nMETHODS: Genomic DNA from blood samples of patients enrolled in FIRE-3 (a global, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial, between 2007-6-23 and 2012-9-19, discovery cohort: FOLFIRI/bevacizumab arm, n = 107; control cohort: FOLFIRI/cetuximab arm, n = 129) and MAVERICC (a global, randomised, open-label, phase II study, between 2011-8 and 2015-7, in United States, Canada, Estonia, Ireland, Switzerland, Norway, and Portugal. Validation cohort: FOLFIRI/bevacizumab arm, n = 163) trials, was genotyped using the OncoArray-500 K beadchip panel. The impact on OS and PFS of 17 selected SNPs in 7 genes involved in the lipid metabolism pathway (CD36, FABP4, LPCAT1/2, CPT1A, FASN, ACACA) was analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test for univariate analyses and likelihood ratio tests of Cox proportional hazards regression parameters for multivariable analyses. ORR and SNP associations were evaluated using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.\nFINDINGS: In the discovery cohort, patients with FASN rs4485435 any C allele (n = 21) showed significantly shorter PFS (median PFS: 8.69 vs 13.48 months) compared to carriers of G/G (n = 62) in multivariable (HR = 2.87; 95%CI 1.4-5.9; p = 0.00675) analysis. These data were confirmed in the validation cohort in multivariable analysis (HR = 2.07, 95%CI: 1.15-3.74; p = 0.02), but no association was observed in the cetuximab cohort of FIRE-3. In the comparison of bevacizumab vs cetuximab arm in FIRE-3, a significant interaction was shown with FASN rs4485435 (p = 0.017) on PFS.\nINTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates for the first time, to our knowledge, that FASN polymorphisms may predict outcome of bevacizumab-based treatment in patients with mCRC. These findings support a possible role of the lipid metabolism pathway in contributing to resistance to anti-VEGF treatment.\nFUNDING: This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute [P30CA 014089 to H.-J.L.], Gloria Borges WunderGlo Foundation, Dhont Family Foundation, Victoria and Philip Wilson Research Fund, San Pedro Peninsula Cancer Guild, Ming Hsieh Research Fund, Eddie Mahoney Memorial Research Fund, Shanghai Sailing Program (22YF1407000), China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents (BX20220084), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022M710768), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202892).",

However, little is known about the mechanism of action. Here, we studied the effects of purified fatty acid molecules on prostate tumor progression using the TRAMP-C2 syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model. Compared with ω-6 or ω-9-supplemented animals, we observed that late-stage prostate tumor growth was reduced with a monoacylglyceride (MAG)-conjugated form of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplementation, whereas docosahexanenoic acid (DHA) caused an early reduction. MAG-EPA significantly decreased tumor blood vessel diameter (P < 0.001). RNA sequencing analysis revealed that MAG-EPA downregulated angiogenesis- and vascular-related pathways in tumors. We also observed this tissue vascular phenotype in a clinical trial testing MAG-EPA versus a high oleic sunflower oil placebo. Using anti-CD31 IHC, we observed that MAG-EPA reduced blood vessel diameter in prostate tumor tissue (P = 0.03) but not in normal adjacent tissue. Finally, testing autocrine and paracrine effects in an avascular tumor spheroid growth assay, both exogenous MAG-EPA and endogenous ω3 reduced VEGF secretion and in vitro endothelial cell tube formation and blocked tumor spheroid growth, suggesting that ω3 molecules can directly hinder prostate cancer cell growth. Altogether, our results suggest that fatty acids regulate prostate cancer growth and that a tumor-specific microenvironment is required for the anti-vascular effect of MAG-EPA in patients with prostate cancer.

Capsaicin has been previously shown to promote vascular health by increasing nitric oxide (NO) production and reducing inflammatory responses. While capsaicin has been extensively studied, whether DHC exerts cardiovascular benefits through similar mechanisms remains unclear. The current study aimed to investigate the direct effects of DHC on endothelial inflammation, NO release, and free radical scavenging properties. DHC at concentrations up to 50 µM did not affect cell viability, while concentrations of 100 and 500 µM of DHC led to endothelial cytotoxicity. Capsaicin decreased cell viability at concentration of 500 µM. To investigate the effects of capsaicinoids on endothelial activation, we first demonstrated that TNFα induced Ser536 phosphorylation of p65 NFκB, expressions of adhesion molecules, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and IL-6 production in primary human endothelial cells. These effects were robustly abrogated by DHC. Consistently, DHC treatment led to a marked reduction in TNFα-mediated monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Additionally, NO production was significantly induced by DHC and capsaicin compared to vehicle control. Similar to capsaicin and vitamin C, DHC scavenged DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) free radicals in vitro. Our present study highlights the benefits of DHC and capsaicin treatment on human endothelial cells and provides evidence to support cardiovascular benefits from capsicum consumption.",

Herein, we aimed to address the therapeutic potential of a novel class of pleiotropic mediators, specifically a new drug candidate, nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA), on AAA, in a well-characterized murine AAA model.\nMETHODS: We generated AAA using a mouse model combining AAV.PCSK9-D377Y induced hypercholesterolemia with angiotensin II given by chronic infusion. Vehicle control (PEG-400), oleic acid (OA), or NO2-OA were subcutaneously delivered to mice using an osmotic minipump. We characterized the effects of NO2-OA on pathophysiological responses and dissected the underlying molecular mechanisms through various in vitro and ex vivo strategies.\nRESULTS: Subcutaneous administration of NO2-OA significantly decreased the AAA incidence (8/28 mice) and supra-renal aorta diameters compared to mice infused with either PEG-400 (13/19, p = 0.0117) or OA (16/23, p = 0.0078). In parallel, the infusion of NO2-OA in the AAA model drastically decreased extracellular matrix degradation, inflammatory cytokine levels, and leucocyte/macrophage infiltration in the vasculature. Administration of NO2-OA reduced inflammation, cytokine secretion, and cell migration triggered by various biological stimuli in primary and macrophage cell lines partially through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). Moreover, the protective effect of NO2-OA relies on the inhibition of macrophage prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced PGE2 receptor 4 (EP4) cAMP signaling, known to participate in the development of AAA.\nCONCLUSION: Administration of NO2-OA protects against AAA formation and multifactorial macrophage activation. With NO2-OA currently undergoing FDA approved phase II clinical trials, these findings may expedite the use of this nitro-fatty acid for AAA therapy.",

However, individual components of an HFD that increase cancer risk have not been isolated. In addition, a specific pattern of cytokine elevation by which MetS drives pancreatic tumor progression is not well described. We hypothesized that oleic acid (OA), a major component of HFD, would augment pancreatic neoplastic processes.\nMETHODS: An orthotopic pancreatic cancer model with Panc02 cells was used to compare the effect of low-fat diet to OA-based HFD on cancer progression. Tumors were quantitated, analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, serum cytokine levels were quantitated. Proliferation, migration assays, and expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition factors were evaluated on Panc02 and MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells cultured in high concentrations of OA.\nRESULTS: HFD tumor-bearing mice (n = 8) had an 18% weight increase (P < 0.001) and increased tumor burden (P < 0.05) compared with the low-fat diet tumor-bearing group (n = 6). HFD tumors had significantly increased angiogenesis (P < 0.001) and decreased apoptosis (P < 0.05). Serum of HFD mice demonstrated increased levels of glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1. Two pancreatic cancer cell lines cultured in OA demonstrated significant increases in proliferation (P < 0.001) and a >2.5-fold increase in cell migration (P < 0.001) when treated with OA. Panc02 treated with OA had increased expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition factors SNAI-1 (Snail) and Zeb-1(P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: High-fat conditions in vitro and in vivo resulted in an aggressive pancreatic cancer phenotype.

    "abstract": "Transcriptomic profiling of several drugs in cancer cell lines has been utilised to obtain drug-specific signatures and guided combination therapy to combat drug resistance and toxicity. Global metabolomics reflects changes due to altered activity of enzymes, environmental factors, etc. Integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics can provide genotype-phenotype correlation, providing meaningful insights into alterations in gene expression and its outcome to understand differential metabolism and guide therapy. This study uses a multi-omics approach to understand the global gene expression and metabolite changes induced by Disarib, a novel Bcl2-specific inhibitor in the Ehrlich adenocarcinoma (EAC) breast cancer mouse model. RNAseq analysis was performed on EAC mouse tumours treated with Disarib and compared to the controls. The expression of 6 oncogenes and 101 tumour suppressor genes interacting with Bcl2 and Bak were modulated upon Disarib treatment. Cancer hallmark pathways like DNA repair, Cell cycle, angiogenesis, and mitochondrial metabolism were downregulated, and programmed cell death platelet-related pathways were upregulated. Global metabolomic profiling using LC-MS revealed that Oncometabolites like carnitine, oleic acid, glycine, and arginine were elevated in tumour mice compared to normal and were downregulated upon Disarib treatment. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles identified arginine metabolism, histidine, and purine metabolism to be altered upon Disarib treatment. Pro-angiogenic metabolites, arginine, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and myristoleic acid were downregulated in Disarib-treated mice. We further validated the effect of Disarib on angiogenesis by qRT-PCR analysis of genes in the VEGF pathway. Disarib treatment led to the downregulation of pro-angiogenic markers. Furthermore, the chorioallantoic membrane assay displayed a reduction in the formation of the number of secondary blood vessels upon Disarib treatment. Disarib reduces tumours by reducing oncometabolite and activating apoptosis and downregulating angiogenesis.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that support the protective role of oleate in cardiovascular cells are poorly known. For these reasons, we studied the protective role of oleate in the insulin resistance and in the atherosclerotic process at cellular level such as in cardiomyocytes (CMs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs).\nMETHODS: The effect of oleate in the cardiovascular insulin resistance, vascular dysfunction, inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs were analyzed by Western blot, qRT-PCR, BrdU incorporation and cell cycle analysis.\nRESULTS: Palmitate induced insulin resistance. However, oleate not only did not induce cardiovascular insulin resistance but also had a protective effect against insulin resistance induced by palmitate or TNFα. One mechanism involved might be the prevention by oleate of JNK-1/2 or NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α or palmitate. Oleate reduced MCP-1 and ICAM-1 and increased eNOS expression induced by proinflammatory cytokines in ECs. Furthermore, oleate impaired the proliferation induced by TNF-α, angiotensin II or palmitate and the apoptosis induced by TNF-α or thapsigargin in VSMCs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a differential role between oleate and palmitate and support the concept of the cardioprotector role of oleate as the main lipid component of virgin olive oil. Thus, oleate protects against cardiovascular insulin resistance, improves endothelial dysfunction in response to proinflammatory signals and finally, reduces proliferation and apoptosis in VSMCs that may contribute to an ameliorated atherosclerotic process and plaque stability.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vasoprotective function of endothelial cells is associated, among others, with biosynthesis and release of nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), carbon monoxide (CO) and plasminogen activator (t-PA). These endothelial mediators calm down activated platelets and leukocytes, prevent the occurrence of parietal thrombotic events, promote thrombolysis, maintain tissue perfusion and protect vascular wall against acute damage and against chronic remodeling. Endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from atherosclerosis or diabetes type 2 is associated not only with suppression in release of the above mediators but also with deleterious discharge of prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGH2, PGG2), superoxide anion (O2-, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). We looked for mechanisms of protective endothelial function, with a special respect to the differences between peripheral and pulmonary circulation.\nMETHODS: Cultured endothelial cells of bovine aorta (BAEC) were used to study physiological and pharmacological mechanisms of increasing free cytoplasmic calcium [Ca2+]i. A porphyrinic sensor quantified the release of NO from BAEC. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) we looked for induction by bradykinin (Bk) of mRNAs for a number of enzymes. In blood perfused rat lungs we studied protective role of NO against injury inferred by lipopolysaccharide on pulmonary microcirculation that was accomplished by thromboxane A2 (TXA2), platelet activating factor (PAF), cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cyst-LTs) and the complement system. In vivo we analyzed the influence of Bk, perindopril and quinapril ('tissue type' angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ACE-Is) on endothelial function in entire circulation of anaesthetized rats using a thrombolytic bioassay and EIA for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and t-PA antigen.\nRESULTS: In BAEC Bk via kinin B2 receptors raised in a concentration-dependent manner (1 pM-10 nM) free cytoplasmic calcium ions [Ca2+]i, that triggered the release of NO from BAEC. Calcium ionophore (A23187, 1-100 nM) as well as receptor agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 10 nM-1 microM), adrenaline (Adr, 1-10 microM) or acetylcholine (Ach, 10-100 microM) produced a similar rise in endothelial [Ca2+]i as did Bk at a nanomolar concentration. 'Tissue type' ACE-Is, e.g. quinapril or perindopril acted through accumulation of endogenous Bk. However, the potency of ACE-I to change endothelial function is by several orders of magnitude lower than that for exogenous Bk. In vivo the major difference between thrombolytic actions by quinapril or perindopril on one hand, and by exogenous Bk on the other was longevity of thrombolysis by ACE I and a distinct hypotensive action of exogenous Bk. Still, the long-lasting isolated thrombolytic effect of ACE I was mediated entirely by endogenous BK as evidenced by the preventive action of icatibant, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist. Moreover, in vivo the immediate thrombolysis by ACE-I was mediated by PGI2 rather than by NO or t-PA, as shown by pharmacological analysis, and by direct blood assays of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and t-PA antigen. Bradykinin as a mediator of pleiotropic endothelial action of several cardiovascular drugs (e.g. ACE-I) may complete its mission not only through B2 receptor and [Ca2+]i--mediated release of PGI2 or NO. Here, we describe a new route of the Bk action. Bk mediated induction of the [Ca2+]i-independent, so called 'inducible', endothelial isoenzymes required for generation of CO, PGI2 and PGE2. After 4 hours of incubation of HUVEC with Bk (10 nM) it induced mRNAs for haemooxygenase 1 (HO-1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E synthase (PGE-S) whereas mRNA for nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) was weakly affected. We proved also that unlike in peripheral circulation, in pulmonary circulation only NO but not PGI2 would play a protective role. In the blood-perfused lung, endotoxaemia liberates lipids, such as TXA2, PAF and cyst-LTs. These toxic lipids along with the activated complement mediate pulmonary damage. Pulmonary endothelial nitric oxide is the only local protector against lung injury evoked by the phagocytised bacterial lipopolysaccharide.\nSUMMARY: Summing up, in peripheral circulation endogenous Bk is the most efficient activator of protective endothelial function. For instance, thrombolytic action of 'tissue type' ACE-I depends on the Bk-released PGI2. Acting as an agonist of endothelial B2 kinin receptors Bk rises [Ca2+]i with a subsequent activation of constitutive COX 1 and NOS-3. This is followed by an immediate release of PGI2 and NO. Moreover, acting as 'microcytokine' Bk induces mRNAs for HO-1, COX-2 and PGE S, the isoenzymes responsible for a delayed endothelial biosynthesis of CO, PGI2 and PGE2. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The formation of vascular lipid droplets (LDs) induced by vascular inflammation or lipid overload contributes to vascular pathophysiology in diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases, while sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) are beneficial in treating these conditions. Thus, we hypothesized that SGLT2-I would directly modify vascular LDs formation during vascular inflammation or lipid overload, and explored underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: LDs formation in isolated murine aorta from wild-type or SGLT2-KO animals was induced by either treatment with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) to induce vascular inflammation or using oleic acid (OA) to mimic lipid overload. Vascular LDs and markers of vascular inflammation were monitored through fluorescence microscopy. Pharmacological inhibitors of sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), endothelial sodium channels (EnNaC), sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), protein kinase C (PKC), and NOX1/4 were used to test their role in empagliflozin's effects on vascular LDs.\nRESULTS: Empagliflozin, dapagliflozin or ertugliflozin inhibited LDs formation in aorta exposed to TNF or OA. Empagliflozin reduced vascular inflammation (based on ICAM-1) and TNF/OA-induced LDs formation. These effects persisted in SGLT2-KO mice. Inhibition of NHE1, PKC or NOX1/4 recapitulated empagliflozin's effects on TNF-induced vascular inflammation, without additional effects of empagliflozin. However, NHE1 inhibition was not involved in the SGLT2-independent reduction of OA-induced LDs formation by empagliflozin.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating that SGLT2-I prevent the formation of LDs in the vasculature. Empagliflozin downregulates LDs formation in vascular inflammation or lipid overload via an SGLT2-independent mechanism. Empagliflozin's protective effects involve the NHE1/PKC/NOX pathway in the TNF response but not in the OA response.",

The endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was monitored by cell surface enzyme immunoassays or flow cytometry, and steady-state levels of VCAM-1 mRNA were assessed by Northern blot analysis. At 10 to 100 micromol/L for >24 hours, oleate inhibited the expression of all adhesion molecules tested. After a 72-hour incubation with oleate and a further 16-hour incubation with oleate plus 1 microg/mL LPS, VCAM-1 expression was reduced by >40% compared with control. Adhesion of monocytoid U937 cells to LPS-treated endothelial cells was reduced concomitantly. Oleate also produced a quantitatively similar reduction of VCAM-1 mRNA levels on Northern blot analysis and inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB activation on electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Incubation of endothelial cells with oleate for 72 hours decreased the relative proportions of saturated (palmitic and stearic) acids in total cell lipids and increased the proportions of oleate in total cell lipids without significantly changing the relative proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although less potent than polyunsaturated fatty acids in inhibiting endothelial activation, oleic acid may contribute to the prevention of atherogenesis through selective displacement of saturated fatty acids in cell membrane phospholipids and a consequent modulation of gene expression for molecules involved in monocyte recruitment.",

Compared with analogous neutral liposomes, strong tumor photoablation was induced with a single treatment of cationic PoP liposomes and laser irradiation (5 mg/kg Dox and 100 J/cm2 NIR light).

We compared the ability of various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids to modulate endothelial activation. Consumption of the n-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) reduced endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-8 in response to IL-1, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor, or bacterial endotoxin, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 1-25 micromol, ie, in the range of nutritionally achievable plasma concentrations. The magnitude of this effect paralleled its incorporation into cellular phospholipids. DHA also reduced the adhesion of human monocytes and monocytic U937 cells to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. These effects were accompanied by a reduction in VCAM-1 messenger RNA, indicating a pretranslational effect. To assess structural fatty acid determinants of VCAM-1 inhibitory activity, we compared various saturated, monounsaturated, and n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for their VCAM-1 inhibitory activity. Saturated fatty acids did not inhibit cytokine-induced expression of adhesion molecules. However, a progressive increase in inhibitory activity was observed with dietary intake of fatty acids with the same chain length but increasing double bonds, ie, from monounsaturated to n-6 and, further, to n-3 fatty acids. Thus, the greater number of double bonds seems critical for the greater activity of n-3 compared with n-6 fatty acids in inhibiting endothelial activation. These properties are likely to be relevant to the antiatherogenic and antiinflammatory properties of n-3 fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Trans fatty acid intake has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The relation is explained only partially by the adverse effect of these fatty acids on the lipid profile. We examined whether trans fatty acid intake could also affect biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR-2), E-selectin, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1). We conducted a cross-sectional study of 730 women from the Nurses' Health Study I cohort, aged 43-69 y, free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes at time of blood draw (1989-1990). Dietary intake was assessed by a validated FFQ in 1986 and 1990. CRP levels were 73% higher among those in the highest quintile of trans fat intake, compared with the lowest quintile. IL-6 levels were 17% higher, sTNFR-2 5%, E-selectin 20%, sICAM-1 10%, and sVCAM-1 levels 10% higher. Trans fatty acid intake was positively related to plasma concentration of CRP (P = 0.009), sTNFR-2 (P = 0.002), E-selectin (P = 0.003), sICAM-1 (P = 0.007), and sVCAM-1 (P = 0.001) in linear regression models after controlling for age, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, intake of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fatty acids, and postmenopausal hormone therapy. In conclusion, this study suggests that higher intake of trans fatty acids could adversely affect endothelial function, which might partially explain why the positive relation between trans fat and cardiovascular risk is greater than one would predict based solely on its adverse effects on lipids.",

Several convergent studies show that capsaicin displays robust cancer activity, suppressing the growth, angiogenesis and metastasis of several human cancers. Despite its potent cancer-suppressing activity, the clinical applications of capsaicin as a viable anti-cancer drug have remained problematic due to its poor bioavailability and aqueous solubility properties. In addition, the administration of capsaicin is associated with adverse side effects like gastrointestinal cramps, stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea and vomiting. All these hurdles may be circumvented by encapsulation of capsaicin in sustained release drug delivery systems. Most of the capsaicin-based the sustained release drugs have been tested for their pain-relieving activity. Only a few of these formulations have been investigated as anti-cancer agents. The present review describes the physicochemical properties, bioavailability, and anti-cancer activity of capsaicin-sustained release agents. The asset of such continuous release capsaicin formulations is that they display better solubility, stability, bioavailability, and growth-suppressive activity than the free drug. The encapsulation of capsaicin in sustained release carriers minimizes the adverse side effects of capsaicin.

As a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids may favour atherosclerosis in hyperglycaemia, this study was performed in both normal and high-glucose media using human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). The HAEC were preincubated with normal (5 mM) or high (25 mM) D-glucose for 3 days before addition of fatty acids (0.2 mM) for 3 days. Linoleic acid enhanced PECAM-1 expression independently of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and significantly increased TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion to HAEC in comparison to the monounsaturated n-9 oleic acid. Chronic glucose treatment (25 mM, 6 days) did not modify the TNF-α-induced or fatty acid-induced changes in monocyte binding. The increase in monocyte binding was accompanied by a significant increase in E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 expression and could be abrogated by an interleukin (IL)-8 neutralising antibody and by the PKC and COX inhibitors. Inhibition of PKC-δ reduced VCAM-1 expression regardless of experimental condition and was accompanied by a significant decrease in monocyte binding. Conditioned medium from linoleic acid-treated HAEC grown in normal glucose conditions significantly increased THP-1 chemotaxis. These results suggest that linoleic acid-induced changes in monocyte chemotaxis and subsequent binding are not solely mediated by changes in adhesion molecule expression but may be due to secreted factors such as IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or prostaglandins (PGs) such as PGE(2), as IL-8 neutralisation and COX-2 inhibition reduced monocyte binding without changes in adhesion molecule expression.",

In this study, we demonstrate that A1AT (Prolastin), a potent inducer of Angptl4, contains significant quantities of the fatty acids (FA) linoleic acid (C18:2) and oleic acid (C18:1). However, only trace amounts of FAs were present in preparations that failed to increase Angplt4 expression, for example, A1AT (Zemaira) or M-type A1AT purified by affinity chromatography. FA pull-down assays with Western blot analysis revealed a FA-binding ability of A1AT. In human blood-adherent monocytes, A1AT-FA conjugates upregulated expression of Angptl4 (54.9-fold, p < 0.001), FA-binding protein 4 (FABP4) (11.4-fold, p < 0.001), and, to a lesser degree, FA translocase (CD36) (3.1-fold, p < 0.001) relative to A1AT devoid of FA (A1AT-0). These latter effects of A1AT-FA were blocked by inhibitors of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β/δ (ST247) and PPARγ (GW9662). When compared with controls, cell pretreatment with ST247 diminished the effect of A1AT-LA on Angptl4 mRNA (11.6- versus 4.1-fold, p < 0.001) and FABP4 mRNA (5.4- versus 2.8-fold, p < 0.001). Similarly, preincubation of cells with GW9662 inhibited inducing effect of A1AT-LA on Angptl4 mRNA (by 2-fold, p < 0.001) and FABP4 mRNA (by 3-fold, p < 0.001). Thus, A1AT binds to FA, and it is this form of A1AT that induces Angptl4 and FABP4 expression via a PPAR-dependent pathway. These findings provide a mechanism for the unexplored area of A1AT biology independent of its antiprotease properties.",

We developed multicellular liver microtissues composed of hepatic stellate cells, hepatoblastoma cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The microtissues were supplemented with a combination of palmitic acid and oleic acid to develop fibrosis models. Subsequently, various groups of microtissues were exposed to SIM and SIM-LipoNPs at doses of 5 and 10 mg/mL. The effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated by analysing cell viability, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), the expression of Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin(IL)-1 α, IL-1 β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α), and the expression of collagen I. Our results indicated that SIM-LipoNPs application showed promising results. SIM-LipoNPs effectively amplified the SIM-klf2-NO pathway at a lower dosage compatible with a high dosage of free SIM, which also led to reduced oxidative stress by decreasing ROS levels. SIM-LipoNPs administration also resulted in a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and Collagen I mRNA levels, as a marker of fibrosis. In conclusion, our study highlights the considerable therapeutic potential of using SIM-LipoNPs to prevent liver fibrosis progress, underscoring the remarkable properties of SIM-LipoNPs in activating the KLF2-NO pathway and anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality, characterized by aggressive progression and poor prognosis. Pathological angiogenesis in HCC is closely linked to metabolic reprogramming, particularly concerning fatty acid metabolism. The interplay between fatty acid metabolism and ferroptosis, a type of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, is emerging as a crucial area of study. The transcription factor SOX4 is known to be overexpressed in various cancers, including HCC, and may play a key role in these processes. We assessed SOX4 expression in HCC using clinical samples and data from online databases. Next-generation RNA sequencing was employed to explore the effects of SOX4 on fatty acid metabolism, focusing on the CHREBP pathway. Functional assays, including lipid peroxidation and angiogenesis studies, were conducted to investigate the role of SOX4 in regulating ferroptosis and angiogenesis in HCC. SOX4 was found to be significantly upregulated in HCC and associated with enhanced angiogenesis. Mechanistically, SOX4 activated the CHREBP/SCD1 pathway, leading to increased production of monounsaturated fatty acids, which in turn inhibited ferroptosis. This suppression of ferroptosis contributed to the promotion of angiogenesis and tumor progression in HCC. In conclusion, SOX4 reprograms fatty acid metabolism via the CHREBP/SCD1 pathway, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and promoting angiogenesis in HCC. These findings suggest that targeting the SOX4-CHREBP axis could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and common malignant primary brain tumor. Patients with GBM often have poor prognoses, with a median survival of ∼15 months. Enhanced understanding of the molecular biology of central nervous system tumors has led to modifications in their classifications, the most recent of which classified these tumors into new categories and made some changes in their nomenclature and grading system. This review aims to give a panoramic view of the last 3 years' findings in glioblastoma characterization, its heterogeneity, and current advances in its treatment. Several molecular parameters have been used to achieve an accurate and personalized characterization of glioblastoma in patients, including epigenetic, genetic, transcriptomic and metabolic features, as well as age- and sex-related patterns and the involvement of several noncoding RNAs in glioblastoma progression. Astrocyte-like neural stem cells and outer radial glial-like cells from the subventricular zone have been proposed as agents involved in GBM of IDH-wildtype origin, but this remains controversial. Glioblastoma metabolism is characterized by upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, promotion of the glycolytic flux, maintenance of lipid storage, and other features. This metabolism also contributes to glioblastoma's resistance to conventional therapies. Tumor heterogeneity, a hallmark of GBM, has been shown to affect the genetic expression, modulation of metabolic pathways, and immune system evasion. GBM's aggressive invasion potential is modulated by cell-to-cell crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment and altered expressions of specific genes, such as ANXA2, GBP2, FN1, PHIP, and GLUT3. Nevertheless, the rising number of active clinical trials illustrates the efforts to identify new targets and drugs to treat this malignancy. Immunotherapy is still relevant for research purposes, given the amount of ongoing clinical trials based on this strategy to treat GBM, and neoantigen and nucleic acid-based vaccines are gaining importance due to their antitumoral activity by inducing the immune response. Furthermore, there are clinical trials focused on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis, angiogenesis, and tumor heterogeneity for developing molecular-targeted therapies against GBM. Other strategies, such as nanodelivery and computational models, may improve the drug pharmacokinetics and the prognosis of patients with GBM.",

Accumulation of fatty acids (FA) metabolites was associated with a low survival rate in high-grade glioma patients. The diversity of brain lipids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is greater than in all other organs and several classes of proteins, such as FA transport proteins (FATPs), and FA translocases are considered principal candidates for PUFAs transport through BBB and delivery of PUFAs to brain cells.

    "abstract": "CD147 also known as EMMPRIN, basigin, and HAb18G, is a single-chain type I transmembrane protein shown to be overexpressed in aggressive human cancers of CNS, head and neck, breasts, lungs, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, skin, hematological, and musculoskeletal. In these malignancies, the molecule is integral to the diverse but complimentary hallmarks of cancer: it is pivotal in cancerous proliferative signaling, growth propagation, cellular survival, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, invasion, and metastasis. CD147 also has regulatory functions in cancer-enabling characteristics such as DNA damage response (DDR) and immune evasion. These neoplastic functions of CD147 are executed through numerous and sometimes overlapping molecular pathways: it transduces signals from upstream molecules or ligands such as cyclophilin A (CyPA), CD98, and S100A9; activates a repertoire of downstream molecules and pathways including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-2,3,9, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1/2α, PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α, and ATM/ATR/p53; and also functions as an indispensable chaperone or regulator to monocarboxylate, fatty acid, and amino acid transporters. Interestingly, induced loss of functions to CD147 prevents and reverses the acquired hallmarks of cancer in neoplastic diseases. Silencing of Cd147 also alleviates known resistance to chemoradiotherapy exhibited by malignant tumors like carcinomas of the breast, lung, pancreas, liver, gastric, colon, ovary, cervix, prostate, urinary bladder, glioblastoma, and melanoma. Targeting CD147 antigen in chimeric and induced-chimeric antigen T cell or antibody therapies is also shown to be safer and more effective. Moreover, incorporating anti-CD147 monoclonal antibodies in chemoradiotherapy, oncolytic viral therapy, and oncolytic virus-based-gene therapies increases effectiveness and reduces on and off-target toxicity. This study advocates the expedition and expansion by further exploiting the evidence acquired from the experimental studies that modulate CD147 functions in hallmarks of cancer and cancer-enabling features and strive to translate them into clinical practice to alleviate the emergency and propagation of cancer, as well as the associated clinical and social consequences.",

PDT is a promising treatment option for glioblastoma, especially when combined with nanoscale drug delivery systems. The curcumin- or parietin-loaded lipid nanoparticles were prepared via dual asymmetric centrifugation and subsequently characterized through physicochemical analyses including dynamic light scattering, laser Doppler velocimetry, and atomic force microscopy. The combination of PDT and lipid nanoparticles has been evaluated in vitro regarding uptake, safety, and efficacy. The extensive and well-vascularized chorioallantois membrane (CAM) of fertilized hen's eggs offers an optimal platform for three-dimensional cell culture, which has been used in this study to evaluate the photodynamic efficacy of lipid nanoparticles against glioblastoma cells. In contrast to other animal models, the CAM model lacks a mature immune system in an early stage, facilitating the growth of xenografts without rejection. Treatment of xenografted U87 glioblastoma cells on CAM was performed to assess the effects on tumor viability, growth, and angiogenesis. The xenografts and the surrounding blood vessels were targeted through topical application, and the effects of photodynamic therapy have been confirmed microscopically and via positron emission tomography and X-ray computed tomography. Finally, the excised xenografts embedded in the CAM were analyzed histologically by hematoxylin and eosin and KI67 staining.",

This article provides a brief overview of mechanism of anti-cancer effect and pharmacology of HDAC inhibitors and summarizes results from pre-clinical and clinical studies in glioblastoma. It analyses experience with HDAC inhibitors as single agents as well as in combination with targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hallmark features of glioblastoma, such as uncontrolled cellular proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis, have been shown to be targeted by HDAC inhibitors in experiments with glioblastoma cell lines.

Multiple phase II trials with vorinostat in combination with targeted agents, temozolomide and radiotherapy are currently recruiting. While the results from pre-clinical studies are encouraging, early clinical trials showed only modest benefit and the value of HDAC inhibitors for clinical practice will need to be confirmed in larger prospective trials.

The detailed ultrastructural survey of 18 isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDH1-wt) glioblastomas and 12 isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant (IDH1-mt) High-grade gliomas indicated that tumor vessels of both types had undergone deformities such as the thickening of the vessel wall (VW) and proliferation of the basement membrane, contour distortions, abnormal and discontinuous basal lamina, tumor cells' invasion and colonization of VW, disappearance of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and smooth muscle cells, as well as the formation of a continuous ring of tumor cells attached to the luminal side of VW in numerous cases.

One of the main challenges in treating GBM is related to the tumor's location, complex and heterogeneous biology, and high invasiveness. To meet the demand for oxygen and nutrients, growing tumors induce new blood vessels growth. Antibodies directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis, have been developed to limit tumor growth. Bevacizumab (Avastin), an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, is the first approved angiogenesis inhibitor with therapeutic promise. However, it has limited efficacy, likely due to adaptive mutations in GBM, leading to overall survival compared to the standard of care in GBM patients. Molecular connections between angiogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress pathways, and the development of gliomas have been recognized. Improvement in treatment outcomes for patients with GBM requires a multifaceted approach due to the converging dysregulation of signaling pathways. While most GBM clinical trials focus on \"anti-angiogenic\" modalities, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue. The selective therapeutic possibilities for targeting the tumor microenvironment, specifically angiogenic and inflammatory pathways expand. So, a combination of agents aiming to interfere with several mechanisms might be beneficial to improve outcomes.

    "abstract": "AIMS: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour in adults. Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis play key roles in progression of GBMs. Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is an intracellular chaperone for free fatty acids. FABP4 is detected in microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) in several normal tissues and promotes proliferation of ECs. The goal of this study was to characterize the tissue distribution pattern of FABP4 in GBMs.\nMETHODS: Immunohistochemistry for FABP4 was performed on paraffin-embedded tumour sections and the intensity and distribution of FABP4 immunoreactivity were analysed. Double immunofluorescence was employed for detailed characterization of FABP4-positive cells.\nRESULTS: FABP4 immunoreactivity was absent in normal brain tissue sections. FABP4-positive cells were detected in 33%, 43%, 64% and 89% of Grade I, Grade II, Grade III and Grade IV glial tumours, respectively. Thus, the percentage of FABP4-positive cells in GBMs was significantly higher than lower-grade gliomas. In general, FABP4-expressing cells were distributed in a non-homogenous pattern, as 'hot spots' in glial tumours. FABP4 expression was detected in a subset of vascular ECs as well as some non-ECs.\nCONCLUSION: FABP4 is expressed in a significantly higher percentage of GBMs in comparison to both normal brain tissues and lower-grade glial tumours. FABP4 is expressed in some tumour ECs as well as non-ECs in glial tumours. As FABP4 promotes proliferation of ECs, detection of FABP4 in GBM-ECs, but not normal brain ECs suggests that FABP4 may play a role in the robust angiogenesis associated with GBMs.",

Given potent anti-cancer efficacy of mefloquine, FDA-approved anti-malarial drug, there is increasing interest in repurposing mefloquine for treatment of cancers, including glioblastoma. In line with these efforts, our work is the first to demonstrate that mefloquine is also an inhibitor of glioblastoma angiogenesis. Using glioblastoma microvascular endothelial cell (GMEC) isolated from glioblastoma patients, we show that mefloquine at clinically achievable concentration inhibits GMEC differentiation, capillary network formation, adhesion to Matrix, growth and survival. Mefloquine also inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells regardless of cellular origin and genetic background. We further show that mefloquine significantly inhibits glioblastoma growth but not formation, and this is associated with decreased glioblastoma angiogenesis in mice. Mechanistically, mefloquine disrupted lysosomal integrity and function in GMECs, leading to oxidative stress and lysosomal lipid damage. Rescue studies confirm that mefloquine acts on GMECs in a lysosomal disruption-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate the anti-angiogenic activity of mefloquine via disrupting lysosomal function. The dual inhibitory role of mefloquine in glioblastoma angiogenesis and glioblastoma displays its advantage over other anti-cancer drugs for glioblastoma treatment.

While the emerging diversity of malignant disease entities affecting brain tissues is often described in reference to their signature alterations within the cellular genome and epigenome, arguably these cell-intrinsic changes can be regarded as hardwired adaptations to a variety of cell-extrinsic microenvironmental circumstances. Conversely, oncogenic events influence the microenvironment through their impact on the cellular secretome, including emission of membranous structures known as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs serve as unique carriers of bioactive lipids, secretable and non-secretable proteins, mRNA, non-coding RNA, and DNA and constitute pathway(s) of extracellular exit of molecules into the intercellular space, biofluids, and blood. EVs are also highly heterogeneous as reflected in their nomenclature (exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles) attempting to capture their diverse origin, as well as structural, molecular, and functional properties. While EVs may act as a mechanism of molecular expulsion, their non-random uptake by heterologous cellular recipients defines their unique roles in the intercellular communication, horizontal molecular transfer, and biological activity. In the central nervous system, EVs have been implicated as mediators of homeostasis and repair, while in cancer they may act as regulators of cell growth, clonogenicity, angiogenesis, thrombosis, and reciprocal tumor-stromal interactions. EVs produced by specific brain tumor cell types may contain the corresponding oncogenic drivers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) in glioblastoma (and hence are often referred to as 'oncosomes'). Through this mechanism, mutant oncoproteins and nucleic acids may be transferred horizontally between cellular populations altering their individual and collective phenotypes. Oncogenic pathways also impact the emission rates, types, cargo, and biogenesis of EVs, as reflected by preliminary analyses pointing to differences in profiles of EV-regulating genes (vesiculome) between molecular subtypes of glioblastoma, and in other brain tumors. Molecular regulators of vesiculation can also act as oncogenes. These intimate connections suggest the context-specific roles of different EV subsets in the progression of specific brain tumors.

It is a highly vascularized tumor, infiltrative, and its tumorigenic capacity is exacerbated. All these hallmarks are therapeutic targets in GBM treatment, including surgical removal followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Current therapies have not been sufficient for the effective patient's management, so the classic therapies have had to expand and incorporate new alternative treatments, including natural compounds. This review summarizes natural products and their physiological effects in in vitro and in vivo models of GBM, specifically by modulating signaling pathways involved in angiogenesis, cell migration/invasion, cell viability, apoptosis, and chemoresistance. The most important aspects of natural products and their derivatives were described in relation to its antitumoral effects. As a final result, it can be obtained that within the compounds with more evidence that supports or suggests its clinical use are the cannabinoids, terpenes, and curcumin, because many have been shown to have a significant effect in decreasing the progress of GBM through known mechanisms, such as chemo-sensitization or decrease migration and cell invasion.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Primary brain tumors, in particular glioblastoma (GBM), remain among the most challenging cancers. Like most malignant tumors, GBM is characterized by hypoxic stress that triggers paracrine, adaptive responses, such as angiogenesis and macrophage recruitment, rescuing cancer cells from metabolic catastrophe and conventional oncological treatments. The unmet need of strategies to efficiently target tumor \"stressness\" represents a strong clinical motivation to better understand the underlying mechanisms of stress adaptation. Here, we have investigated how lipid loading may be involved in the paracrine crosstalk between cancer cells and the stromal compartment of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.\nMETHODS: Regions from patient GBM tumors with or without the lipid loaded phenotype were isolated by laser capture microdissection and subjected to comparative gene expression analysis in parallel with cultured GBM cells with or without lipid loading. The potential involvement of extracellular lipids in the paracrine crosstalk with stromal cells was studied by immunoprofiling of the secretome and functional studies in vitro as well as in various orthotopic GBM mouse models, including hyperlipidemic ApoE-/- mice. Statistical analyses of quantitative experimental methodologies were performed using unpaired Student's T test. For survival analyses of mouse experiments, log-rank test was used, whereas Kaplan-Meier was performed to analyze patient survival.\nRESULTS: We show that the lipid loaded niche of GBM patient tumors exhibits an amplified hypoxic response and that the acquisition of extracellular lipids by GBM cells can reinforce paracrine activation of stromal cells and immune cells. At the functional level, we show that lipid loading augments the secretion of e.g. VEGF and HGF, and may potentiate the cross-activation of endothelial cells and macrophages. In line with these data, in vivo studies suggest that combined local tumor lipid loading and systemic hyperlipidemia of ApoE-/- mice receiving a high fat diet induces tumor vascularization and macrophage recruitment, and was shown to significantly decrease animal survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, these data identify extracellular lipid loading as a potentially targetable modulator of the paracrine adaptive response in the hypoxic tumor niche and suggest the contribution of the distinct lipid loaded phenotype in shaping the glioma microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumour in the central nervous system, but the current treatment is very limited and unsatisfactory. PGE2 -initiated cAMP signalling via EP2 and EP4 receptors is involved in the tumourigenesis of multiple cancer types. However, whether or how EP2 and EP4 receptors contribute to GBM growth largely remains elusive.\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We performed comprehensive data analysis of gene expression in human GBM samples and determined their expression correlations through multiple bioinformatics approaches. A time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay was utilized to characterize PGE2 -mediated cAMP signalling via EP2 and EP4 receptors in human glioblastoma cells. Using recently reported potent and selective small-molecule antagonists, we determined the effects of inhibition of EP2 and EP4 receptors on GBM growth in subcutaneous and intracranial tumour models.\nKEY RESULTS: The expression of both EP2 and EP4 receptors was upregulated and highly correlated with a variety of tumour-promoting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in human gliomas. Further, they were heterogeneously expressed in human GBM cells, where they compensated for each other to mediate PGE2 -initiated cAMP signalling and to promote colony formation, cell invasion and migration. Inhibition of EP2 and EP4 receptors revealed that these receptors might mediate GBM growth, angiogenesis, and immune evasion in a compensatory manner.\nCONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The compensatory roles of EP2 and EP4 receptors in GBM development and growth suggest that concurrently targeting these two PGE2 receptors might represent a more effective strategy than inhibiting either alone for GBM treatment.",

RTKs are central to GBM progression, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. However, the complexity of RTK signaling necessitates a broader, integrative perspective, which has been enabled by the emergence of -omics sciences. Multi-omics technologies-including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-offer unprecedented insights into the molecular landscape of GBM and its RTK-driven pathways.

A shift in this balance toward S1P is seen in glioblastoma (GBM) and other cancers, and results in tumor cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Sphingosine kinase (SK), the enzyme responsible for transforming sphingosine into S1P, plays the critical role in modulating the balance between S1P and ceramides.

In the brain, eicosanoids are primarily derived from arachidonic acid, which is released from membrane phospholipids in response to various stimuli. Prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) are the major classes of eicosanoids produced in the brain, and they act through specific receptors to modulate various physiological and pathological processes. Dysregulation of eicosanoids has been implicated in the development and progression of brain tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM), meningioma, and medulloblastoma.

Hypoxia plays a critical role during tumor progression and in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Exosomes released by tumor cells contain informative nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids involved in the interaction between cancer and stromal cells, thus leading to TME remodeling. Accumulating evidence indicates that exosomes play a pivotal role in cell-to-cell communication. However, the mechanism by which hypoxia affects tumor angiogenesis via exosomes derived from tumor cells remains largely unknown. In our study, we found that, compared with the parental cells under normoxic conditions, the GBM cells produced more exosomes, and miR-182-5p was significantly upregulated in the exosomes from GBM cells under hypoxic conditions. Exosomal miR-182-5p directly suppressed its targets Kruppel-like factor 2 and 4, leading to the accumulation of VEGFR, thus promoting tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, exosome-mediated miR-182-5p also inhibited tight junction-related proteins (such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5), thus enhancing vascular permeability and tumor transendothelial migration. Knockdown of miR-182-5p reduced angiogenesis and tumor proliferation.

    "abstract": "Malignant glioma is one of the most lethal cancers with rapid progression, high recurrence, and poor prognosis in the central nervous system. Fatty acid-binding protein 6 (FABP6) is a bile acid carrier protein that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer. This study aimed to assess the involvement of FABP6 expression in the progression of malignant glioma. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that FABP6 expression was higher in glioma than in normal brain tissue. After the knockdown of FABP6, a decrease in the migration and invasion abilities of glioma cells was observed. The phosphorylation of the myosin light chain was inhibited, which may be associated with migration ability. Moreover, expression levels of invasion-related proteins, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and cathepsin B, were reduced. Furthermore, tube formation was inhibited in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells with a decreased concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the conditioned medium after the knockdown of FABP6. The phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p65 were also decreased after FABP6 reduction. Finally, the bioluminescent images and immunostaining of MMP-2, cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), and the VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) revealed attenuated tumor progression in the combination of the FABP6-knocked-down and temozolomide (TMZ)-treated group in an orthotopic xenograft mouse tumor model. This is the first study that revealed the impact of FABP6 on the invasion, angiogenesis, and progression of glioma. The results of this study show that FABP6 may be a potential therapeutic target combined with TMZ for malignant gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Its prognosis is one of the worst among all cancer types, and it is considered a fatal malignancy, incurable with conventional therapeutic strategies. As the bioactive multifunctional lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is well recognized to be involved in the tumorigenesis of cancers by acting on G-protein-coupled receptors, LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonists and LPA synthesis inhibitors have been proposed as promising drugs for cancer treatment. Six LPARs, named LPA1-6, are currently recognized. Among them, LPA1 is the dominant LPAR in the CNS and is highly expressed in GBM in combination with the overexpression of autotaxin (ATX), the enzyme (a phosphodiesterase, which is a potent cell motility-stimulating factor) that produces LPA.Invasion is a defining hallmark of GBM. LPA is significantly related to cell adhesion, cell motility, and invasion through the Rho family GTPases Rho and Rac. LPA1 is responsible for LPA-driven cell motility, which is attenuated by LPA4. GBM is among the most vascular human tumors. Although anti-angiogenic therapy (through the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) was established, sufficient results have not been obtained because of the increased invasiveness triggered by anti-angiogenesis. As both ATX and LPA play a significant role in angiogenesis, similar to VEGF, inhibition of the ATX/LPA axis may be beneficial as a two-pronged therapy that includes anti-angiogenic and anti-invasion therapy. Conventional approaches to GBM are predominantly directed at cell proliferation. Recurrent tumors regrow from cells that have invaded brain tissues and are less proliferative, and are thus quite resistant to conventional drugs and radiation, which preferentially kill rapidly proliferating cells. A novel approach that targets this invasive subpopulation of GBM cells may improve the prognosis of GBM. Patients with GBM that contacts the subventricular zone (SVZ) have decreased survival. A putative source of GBM cells is the SVZ, the largest area of neurogenesis in the adult human brain. GBM stem cells in the SVZ that are positive for the neural stem cell surface antigen CD133 are highly tumorigenic and enriched in recurrent GBM. LPA1 expression appears to be increased in these cells. Here, the author reviews research on the ATX/LPAR axis, focusing on GBM and an ATX/LPAR-targeted approach.",

One of the proteins expressed in glioblastoma tissue is CHI3L1 (YKL-40), which is upregulated and known for its angiogenesis-supporting and pro-tumour immunomodulatory effects in a variety of cancers. In this paper we present the anti-angiogenic, anti-migratory and immunomodulatory effects of the compound G721-0282, an inhibitor of CHI3L1. The inhibitor-induced changes were investigated using conventional techniques as well as the novel label-free digital holographic tomography (DHT), a quantitative phase imaging technique that allows the reconstruction of the refractive index (RI), which is used as an image contrast for 3D visualisation of living cells. DHT allowed digital staining of individual cells and intercellular structures based only on their specific RI. Quantitative spatially resolved analysis of the RI data shows that the concentration of G721-0282 leads to significant changes in the density of cells and their intracellular structures (in particular the cytoplasm and nucleus), in the volume of lipid droplets and in protein concentrations. Studies in the U-87 MG glioblastoma cell line, THP-1 monocytes differentiated into macrophages, human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) and in the spheroid model of glioblastoma composed of U-87 MG, HMEC-1 and macrophages suggest that inhibition of CHI3L1 may have potential in the antitumour treatment of glioblastoma.

However inadequate phototherapy due to stability of the photosensitizer and low target specificity induces the proliferation of neovascular endothelial cells for angiogenesis and causes poor prognosis.\nMETHODS: In this study, we constructed c(RGDfk)-modified glycolipid-like micelles (cRGD-CSOSA) encapsulating indocyanine green (ICG) for dual-targeting neovascular endothelial cells and tumor cells, and cRGD-CSOSA/ICG mediated dual effect of PDT/PTT with NIR irradiation.\nRESULTS: In vitro, cRGD-CSOSA/ICG inhibited cell proliferation and blocked angiogenesis with NIR irradiation. In vivo, cRGD-CSOSA/ICG exhibited increased accumulation in neovascular endothelial cells and tumor cells. Compared with that of CSOSA, the accumulation of cRGD-CSOSA in tumor tissue was further improved after dual-targeted phototherapy pretreatment. With NIR irradiation, the tumor-inhibition rate of cRGD-CSOSA/ICG was 80.00%, significantly higher than that of ICG (9.08%) and CSOSA/ICG (42.42%). Histological evaluation showed that the tumor vessels were reduced and that the apoptosis of tumor cells increased in the cRGD-CSOSA/ICG group with NIR irradiation.\nCONCLUSION: The cRGD-CSOSA/ICG nanoparticle-mediated dual-targeting phototherapy could enhance drug delivery to neovascular endothelial cells and tumor cells for anti-angiogenesis and improve the phototherapy effect of glioblastoma, providing a new strategy for glioblastoma treatment.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive, highly proliferative, invasive brain tumor with a poor prognosis and low survival rate. The current standard of care for GBM is chemotherapy combined with radiation following surgical intervention, altogether with limited efficacy, since survival averages 18 months. Improvement in treatment outcomes for patients with GBM requires a multifaceted approach due to the dysregulation of numerous signaling pathways. Recently emerging therapies to precisely modulate tumor angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative stress are gaining attention as potential options to combat GBM. Using a mouse model of GBM, this study aims to investigate Avastin (suppressor of vascular endothelial growth factor and anti-angiogenetic treatment), LAU-0901 (a platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist that blocks pro-inflammatory signaling), Elovanoid; ELV, a novel pro-homeostatic lipid mediator that protects neural cell integrity and their combination as an alternative treatment for GBM. Female athymic nude mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, and luciferase-modified U87MG tumor cells were stereotactically injected into the right striatum. On post-implantation day 13, mice received one of the following: LAU-0901, ELV, Avastin, and all three compounds in combination. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was performed on days 13, 20, and 30 post-implantation. Mice were perfused for ex vivo MRI on day 30. Bioluminescent intracranial tumor growth percentage was reduced by treatments with LAU-0901 (43%), Avastin (77%), or ELV (86%), individually, by day 30 compared to saline treatment. In combination, LAU-0901/Avastin, ELV/LAU-0901, or ELV/Avastin had a synergistic effect in decreasing tumor growth by 72, 92, and 96%, respectively. Additionally, tumor reduction was confirmed by MRI on day 30, which shows a decrease in tumor volume by treatments with LAU-0901 (37%), Avastin (67%), or ELV (81.5%), individually, by day 30 compared to saline treatment. In combination, LAU-0901/Avastin, ELV/LAU-0901, or ELV/Avastin had a synergistic effect in decreasing tumor growth by 69, 78.7, and 88.6%, respectively. We concluded that LAU-0901 and ELV combined with Avastin exert a better inhibitive effect in GBM progression than monotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the efficacy of these novel therapeutic regimens in a model of GBM and may provide the basis for future therapeutics in GBM patients.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids, is regulated by cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and various signaling pathways related to cancer. In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREPB1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these cells, even when mTORC1 was inhibited. In xenograft mouse models for PI3K-mutated breast cancer and PTEN-defective prostate cancer, the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction resulted in near-complete tumor regression. In conclusion, hyperactive mutation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling protects cancer cells from oxidative stress and ferroptotic death through SREBP1/SCD1-mediated lipogenesis, and combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models.",

However, the study about potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of Sal-anchored TNBC remains limited.\nOBJECTIVE: This study was designed to explore the main targets and potential mechanisms of Sal against TNBC.\nMETHODS: Network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and machine learning algorithm strategies were integrated to examine the role, potential targets, and mechanisms of the Sal act in TNBC. MDA-MB-231 cells and tumor-bearing nude mice were chosen for in vitro and in vivo experimentation. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were determined using CCK-8, LDH test, and Calcein-AM/PI staining. Antioxidant defense, lipid peroxidation, and iron metabolism were explored using glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde (MDA), C11-BODIPY 581/591 probe, and FerroOrange dye. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) or stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) overexpression or nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4) deficiency was performed to demonstrate the mechanism of Sal on TNBC.\nRESULTS: The prediction results confirmed that 22 ferroptosis-related genes were identified in Sal and TNBC, revealing that the potential mechanism of the Sal act on TNBC was linked with ferroptosis. Besides, these genes were mainly involved in the mTOR, PI3K/AKT, and autophagy signaling pathway by functional enrichment analysis. The in vitro validation results confirmed that Sal inhibited TNBC cell proliferation by modulating ferroptosis via elevation of intracellular Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation. Mechanistically, Sal sensitized TNBC cells to ferroptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, thereby suppressing SCD1-mediated lipogenesis of monounsaturated fatty acids to induce lipid peroxidation, additionally facilitating NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy to increase intracellular Fe2+ content. The GPX4 or SCD1 overexpression or NCOA4 deficiency results further supported our mechanistic studies. In vivo experimentation confirmed that Sal is vital for slowing down tumor growth by inducing ferroptosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study elucidates TNBC pathogenesis closely linked to ferroptosis and identifies potential biomarkers in TNBC. Meanwhile, the study elucidates that Sal sensitizes TNBC to ferroptosis by SCD1-mediated lipogenesis and NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy, regulated by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for applying Sal to treat TNBC.",

However, the detailed mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells dictating their lipid metabolic activities in promoting tumor progression remain elusive. Methods: The omental conditioned medium (OCM) was established to imitate the omental or ascites microenvironment. Mass spectrometry, RT-qPCR, IHC, and western blot assays were applied to evaluate human fatty acid desaturases expressions and activities. Pharmaceutical inhibition and genetic ablation of SCD1/FADS2 were performed to observe the oncogenic capacities. RNA sequencing, lipid peroxidation, cellular iron, ROS, and Mito-Stress assays were applied to examine ferroptosis. OvCa patient-derived organoid and mouse model of peritoneal metastases were used to evaluate the combined effect of SCD1/FADS2 inhibitors with cisplatin. Results: We found that two critical fatty acid desaturases, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) and acyl-CoA 6-desaturase (FADS2), were aberrantly upregulated, accelerating lipid metabolic activities and tumor aggressiveness of ascites-derived OvCa cells. Lipidomic analysis revealed that the elevation of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) was positively associated with SCD1/FADS2 levels and the oncogenic capacities of OvCa cells. In contrast, pharmaceutical inhibition and genetic ablation of SCD1/FADS2 retarded tumor growth, cancer stem cell (CSC) formation and reduced platinum resistance. Inhibition of SCD1/FADS2 directly downregulated GPX4 and the GSH/GSSG ratio, causing disruption of the cellular/mitochondrial redox balance and subsequently, iron-mediated lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction in ascites-derived OvCa cells. Conclusions: Combinational treatment with SCD1/FADS2 inhibitors and cisplatin synergistically repressed tumor cell dissemination, providing a promising chemotherapeutic strategy against EOC peritoneal metastases.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death triggered by the iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids, is associated with cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and various signaling pathways related to cancer. Aspirin is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and has been reported to show therapeutic benefit in cancers harboring oncogenic PIK3CA, which encodes the catalytic p110α subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). In this study, we found that aspirin sensitized cancer cells harboring oncogenic activation of PIK3CA to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, aspirin inhibited protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, suppressed downstream sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) expression, and attenuated stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1)-mediated lipogenesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, thus promoting RSL3-induced ferroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Moreover, genetic ablation of SREBP-1 or SCD1 conferred cancer cells greater sensitivity to ferroptosis induction. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREBP-1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in CRC cells and abolished the effect of aspirin on RSL3-induced cytotoxicity. Additionally, the synergistic effects of aspirin and RSL3 were confirmed in a xenograft mouse model. The combined use of aspirin and RSL3 resulted in significant tumor suppression. Our work demonstrated that aspirin enhanced the cytotoxic effect of RSL3 in PIK3CA-mutant cancers, and the combination of aspirin and ferroptosis inducer displayed promising therapeutic effects in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Understanding the mechanisms of non-T cell inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME) and their modulation are important to improve cancer immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. The involvement of various immunometabolisms has recently been indicated in the formation of immunosuppressive TME. In this study, we investigated the immunological roles of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which is essential for fatty acid metabolism, in the cancer immune response.\nMETHODS: We investigated the roles of SCD1 by inhibition with the chemical inhibitor or genetic manipulation in antitumor T cell responses and the therapeutic effect of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody using various mouse tumor models, and their cellular and molecular mechanisms. The roles of SCD1 in human cancers were also investigated by gene expression analyses of colon cancer tissues and by evaluating the related free fatty acids in sera obtained from patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1 antibody.\nRESULTS: Systemic administration of a SCD1 inhibitor in mouse tumor models enhanced production of CCL4 by cancer cells through reduction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and by CD8+ effector T cells through reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. It in turn promoted recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) into the tumors and enhanced the subsequent induction and tumor accumulation of antitumor CD8+ T cells. SCD1 inhibitor was also found to directly stimulate DCs and CD8+ T cells. Administration of SCD1 inhibitor or SCD1 knockout in mice synergized with an anti-PD-1 antibody for its antitumor effects in mouse tumor models. High SCD1 expression was observed in one of the non-T cell-inflamed subtypes in human colon cancer, and serum SCD1 related fatty acids were correlated with response rates and prognosis of patients with non-small lung cancer following anti-PD-1 antibody treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: SCD1 expressed in cancer cells and immune cells causes immunoresistant conditions, and its inhibition augments antitumor T cells and therapeutic effects of anti-PD-1 antibody. Therefore, SCD1 is an attractive target for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve current cancer immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Activation of ferroptosis, a recently described mechanism of regulated cell death, dramatically inhibits growth of ovarian cancer cells. Given the importance of lipid metabolism in ferroptosis and the key role of lipids in ovarian cancer, we examined the contribution to ferroptosis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1, SCD), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis in ovarian cancer cells. SCD1 was highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissue, cell lines, and a genetic model of ovarian cancer stem cells. Inhibition of SCD1 induced lipid oxidation and cell death. Conversely, overexpression of SCD or exogenous administration of its C16:1 and C18:1 products, palmitoleic acid or oleate, protected cells from death. Inhibition of SCD1 induced both ferroptosis and apoptosis. Inhibition of SCD1 decreased CoQ10, an endogenous membrane antioxidant whose depletion has been linked to ferroptosis, while concomitantly decreasing unsaturated fatty acyl chains in membrane phospholipids and increasing long-chain saturated ceramides, changes previously linked to apoptosis. Simultaneous triggering of two death pathways suggests SCD1 inhibition may be an effective component of antitumor therapy, because overcoming this dual mechanism of cell death may present a significant barrier to the emergence of drug resistance. Supporting this concept, we observed that inhibition of SCD1 significantly potentiated the antitumor effect of ferroptosis inducers in both ovarian cancer cell lines and a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Our results suggest that the use of combined treatment with SCD1 inhibitors and ferroptosis inducers may provide a new therapeutic strategy for patients with ovarian cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of SCD1 inhibitors and ferroptosis inducers may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ovarian cancer patients.See related commentary by Carbone and Melino, p. 5149.",

In this study, we observe that lactate-rich liver cancer cells exhibit enhanced resistance to the ferroptotic damage induced by common ferroptosis inducers such as Ras-selective lethal small molecule 3 (RSL3) and Erastin and that the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated lactate uptake could promote ATP production in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and deactivate the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the downstream stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-1 (SCD1) to enhance the production of anti-ferroptosis monounsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, blocking the lactate uptake via hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1)/MCT1 inhibition promotes ferroptosis by activating the AMPK to downregulate SCD1, which may synergize with its acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 4 (ACSL4)-promoting effect to amplify the ferroptotic susceptibility.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a malignancy with high mortality. Once diagnosed, effective treatment strategies are limited and the five-year survival is extremely poor. Recent studies have shown that zinc finger proteins play important roles in tumorigenesis, including pancreatic cancer. However, it remains unknown on the clinical significance, function and underlying mechanisms of zinc finger protein 488 (ZNF488) during the development of pancreatic cancer.\nMETHODS: The clinical relevance of ZNF488 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) was examined by analyzing the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and immunohistochemical staining of the tissue microarray. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were performed by transfecting the cells with overexpressing lentivirus and siRNAs or shRNA lentivirus, respectively. The function of ZNF488 in pancreatic cancer was assessed by CCK8, colony formation, EdU staining, PI/Annexin V staining and xenografted tumorigenesis. Chip-qPCR assay was conducted to examine the interaction between ZNF488 and the promoter sequence of SCD1. Transcription activity was measured by dual luciferase reporter assay. mRNA and protein expression was detected by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting experiment, respectively. Fatty acid was quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.\nRESULTS: ZNF488 was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer samples compared with normal tissues. High expression of ZNF488 predicted the poor prognosis of the patients. In vitro, ZNF488 upregulation contributed to the EuU cooperation, proliferation and colony formation of MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Based on PI/Annexin V and trypan blue staining results, we showed that ZNF488 suppressed the ferroptosis and apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, ZNF488 directly interacted with the promoter sequence of SCD1 gene and promoted its transcription activity, which resulted in enhanced palmitoleic and oleic acid production, as well as the peroxidation of fatty acid. In vivo, ZNF488 overexpression promoted the xenograted tumorigenesis of PANC-1, which was reversed by SCD1 knockdown. Importantly, combination of erastin and SCD1 inhibitors A939572 completely blunted the growth of ZNF488 overexpressed MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Usage of A939572 or erastin recovered the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to the treatment of gemcitabine. Lastly, we found a positive correlation between ZNF488 and SCD1 in pancreatic cancer patients based on TCGA and immunohistochemical staining results.\nCONCLUSION: Overexpression of ZNF488 suppresses the ferroptosis and apoptosis to support the growth and tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer through augmentation of SCD1-mediated unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. Combination of SCD1 inhibitors, ferroptosis inducers or gemcitabine could be applied for the treatment of pancreatic cancer with overexpression of ZNF488.",

Elucidation of the underlying biology of this aggressive LUAD subset is needed to develop effective treatments to improve patient outcomes. Our transcriptomic analysis of 5,498 \"real-world\" KRASmut LUADs demonstrated that STK11/KEAP1 co-mutation led to upregulation of fatty acid and redox signaling pathways and considerable enrichment of the metabolic genes SCD1 and SLC7A11. High expression of SCD1 and SLC7A11 predicted poor prognosis in KRASmut patients.

The enhanced infiltration of stromal tissue into the PCa tumor microenvironment limits the identification of key tumor-specific transcription factors and epigenomic abnormalities in malignant epithelial cells. Integrated transcriptome and epigenetic multiomics analyses of the paired PCa organoids indicate that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 40 (BHLHE40) is significantly upregulated in tumor samples. Increased chromatin accessibility at the promoter region and enhanced mTOR pathway activity contribute to the elevated expression of BHLHE40. Integrated analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq, RNA-seq, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture data, together with chromosome conformation capture assays, indicate that BHLHE40 not only regulates sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1 (SREBF1) transcription as a classic transcription factor but also links the enhancer and promoter regions of SREBF1. It is found that the BHLHE40-SREBF1-stearoyl-CoA desaturase axis protects PCa cells from ferroptosis, resulting in the reduced accumulation of lipid peroxidation.

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presents a risk of carcinogenesis, which escalates with the duration of IBD. Persistent histological inflammation is considered to be the driving factor of colitis carcinogenesis. Effective control of inflammation is helpful to prevent and treat colitis-related colorectal cancer (CAC). Anchang Yuyang Decoction (AYD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, is originated from the ancient prescription of TCM for treating colitis and colorectal cancer. AYD has demonstrated efficacy in treating IBD and potential anti-carcinogenic properties.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: This research aims to assess the therapeutic efficacy of AYD in ameliorating experimental colitis-related carcinogenesis induced by AOM/DSS. It further seeks to elucidate its potential mechanisms by integrating multiple omics sequencing approaches.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model for colitis-related carcinogenesis was developed using azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). UPLC-MS identified AYD's chemical constituents. Rats were administered varying doses of AYD (18.37, 9.19 and 4.59 g/kg) orally for 53 days, with mesalazine as a positive control. The study evaluated anti-carcinogenic effects by examining adenoma number, adenoma load, abnormal crypt foci (ACF), histopathological damage, and tumor-related protein expression. Anti-inflammatory and reparative effects were assessed through body weight, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, spleen index, inflammatory cytokine levels, and tight junction protein expression. The effects on intestinal microbiota and host metabolism were explored through 16S rRNA sequencing, targeted short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabonomics, and non-targeted colon metabolomics. Potential AYD targets were identified through transcriptomic sequencing and validated by qRT-PCR and western blotting.\nRESULTS: AYD significantly reduced adenoma number, adenoma load, neoplasm-associated lesions, ACF, and tumor-related protein expression (e.g., p53, PCNA) in AOM/DSS-induced rats, thus impeding colitis-related carcinogenesis progression. AYD also alleviated histopathological damage and inflammation, promoting intestinal mucosal barrier repair. Furthermore, AYD modulated intestinal flora structure, enhanced SCFA production, and regulated colon metabolites. Transcriptomic sequencing revealed a significant impact on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. Subsequent qRT-PCR and western blotting experiments indicated AYD's influence in up-regulating PPAR-γ and down-regulating PPAR-α, PPAR-β/δ, and related proteins (thrombomodulin [Thbd], fatty acid binding protein 5 [Fabp5], stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 [Scd2], phospholipid transfer protein [Pltp]).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates AYD's ability to inhibit experimental colitis-related carcinogenesis induced by AOM/DSS. Its mechanism likely involves modulation of the PPAR signaling pathway, impacting intestinal microbiota and host metabolic equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The sex differences in the occurrence and fatality rates of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), along with its association with estrogen dependence, suggest that estrogen receptors (ERs) contribute to the development of NSCLC. However, the influence of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1) on NSCLC remains to be determined. Escape from ferroptosis is one of the hallmarks of tumor discovered in recent years. In this context, the present study evaluated whether GPER1 promotes NSCLC progression by preventing ferroptosis, and the underlying mechanism through which GPER1 protects against ferroptosis was also explored.\nMETHODS: The effects of GPER1 on the cytotoxicity of H2O2, the ferroptosis inducer RSL3, and Erastin were assessed using the CCK8 assay and plate cloning. Lipid peroxidation levels were measured based on the levels of MDA and BODIPY™581/591C11. GPER1 overexpression and knockdown were performed and G1 was used, and the expression of SCD1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling factors was measured. Immunofluorescence analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed on paired specimens to measure the correlation between the expression of GPER1 and SCD1 in NSCLC tissues. The effect of GPER1 on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin was measured in vitro using the CCK8 assay and in vivo using xenograft tumor models.\nRESULTS: GPER1 and G1 alleviated the cytotoxicity of H2O2, reduced sensitivity to RSL3, and impaired lipid peroxidation in NSCLC tissues. In addition, GPER1 and G1 promoted the protein and mRNA expression of SCD1 and the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. GPER1 and SCD1 expression were elevated and positively correlated in NSCLC tissues, and high GPER1 expression predicted a poor prognosis. GPER1 knockdown enhanced the antitumor activity of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo.\nCONCLUSION: GPER1 prevents ferroptosis in NSCLC by promoting the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, thereby inducing SCD1 expression. Therefore, treatments targeting GPER1 combined with cisplatin would exhibit better antitumor effects.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide with no approved therapy. The development of ALD is strongly associated with hepatic lipid accumulation. Arrestin domain containing 3 (ARRDC3), a member of the α-arrestin family, is involved in obesity, inflammation, and cancer. However, its role in ALD remains largely unexplored.\nMETHODS: Both the NIAAA and traditional Lieber-De Carli mouse models of ALD were employed. ARRDC3 expression was evaluated in liver specimens from ALD patients, mouse hepatic tissues, and hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-targeted Arrdc3 knockdown was achieved through intrahepatic delivery of adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) carrying shRNA under a hepatocyte-specific promoter. Mass spectrometry analysis, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, and molecular docking were used to identify the interaction between ARRDC3 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1).\nRESULTS: ARRDC3 levels were significantly elevated in the livers of both ALD patients and mouse models. Knockdown of Arrdc3 using AAV8 alleviated alcohol-induced liver steatosis in both the NIAAA and traditional Lieber-De Carli mouse models. We demonstrated that ARRDC3 promoted the progression of ALD by inducing lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Mechanistically, ARRDC3 directly binds to SCD1 and inhibits its ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. Inhibition of SCD1 blocked ARRDC3-induced lipid deposition in hepatocytes. We also observed a correlation between ARRDC3 and SCD1 in liver samples from ALD patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that ARRDC3 promotes hepatic steatosis in ALD by reducing the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of SCD1. ARRDC3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for ALD.",

OA reverses the fructose-induced increase in hepatic triglyceride (TG) content and downregulates Scd1 mRNA expression. However, two upstream transcription factors, ChREBP and SREBP1c, remain at normal levels with or without fructose and/or OA.

On the other hand, in SCD1-/- mice, when the fructose diet is supplemented with high levels of oleic acid (OLA) to compensate for the deficiency of SCD1, OA inhibits hepatic SREBP1c and lipogenic gene expression and reduces hepatic OLA (C18:1) production to improve fructose and/or OLA induced liver lipid deposition.

Lactic acid, a key metabolite produced from the glycolytic metabolism of glucose molecules, is correlated with tumor immune infiltration and platinum resistance. In our previous study, we found that endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1) plays a key role in OC progression. This study revealed that lactate could upregulate ESM1, which enhances SCD1 to attenuate the antitumor CD8+ T-cell response. ESM1 and SCD1 expression levels were significantly greater in OC patients with high lactic acid levels than in those with low lactic acid levels. Further mechanistic studies suggested that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was inactivated after ESM1 knockdown and rescued by SCD1 overexpression. IC50 analysis indicated that the ESM1-SCD1 axis induces the resistance of OC cells to platinum agents, including cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, by upregulating P-gp. In conclusion, our study indicated that the induction of SCD1 by lactic acid-induced ESM1 can impede the CD8+ T-cell response against tumors and promote resistance to cisplatin by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in ovarian cancer.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated the functional role and clinical significance of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in regulating liver tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) and sorafenib resistance, with the aim of developing a novel therapeutic strategy against hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).\nMETHODS: We evaluated the clinic-pathological relevance of SCD1 and its correlation with sorafenib resistance in large cohorts of HCC clinical samples by qPCR and immunohistochemical analyses. Lentiviral-based overexpression and knockdown approaches were performed to characterize the functional roles of SCD1 in regulating liver T-ICs and sorafenib resistance. Molecular pathways mediating the phenotypic alterations were identified through RNA sequencing analysis and functional rescue experiments. The combinatorial effect of SCD1 inhibition and sorafenib was tested using a patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model.\nRESULTS: SCD1 overexpression was found in HCC, which was associated with shorter disease-free survival (p = 0.008, log rank test). SCD1 was found to regulate the populations of liver T-ICs; while its suppression by a SCD1 inhibitor suppressed liver T-ICs and sorafenib resistance. Interestingly, SCD1 was markedly upregulated in our established sorafenib-resistant PDTX model, and its overexpression predicts the clinical response of HCC patients to sorafenib treatment. Suppression of SCD1 forces liver T-ICs to differentiate via ER stress-induced unfolded protein response, resulting in an enhanced sensitivity to sorafenib. The PDTX#1 model, combined with sorafenib treatment and a novel SCD1 inhibitor (SSI-4), showed a maximal growth suppressive effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: SCD1-mediated ER stress regulates liver T-ICs and sorafenib sensitivity. Targeting SCD1 alone or in combination with sorafenib might be a novel personalized medicine against HCC. Lay summary: In this study, SCD1 was found to play a critical role in regulating liver tumor-initiating cells and sorafenib resistance through the regulation of ER stress-mediated differentiation. Targeting SCD1 in combination with sorafenib may be a novel therapeutic strategy against liver cancer.",

Owing to the limited targets and drugs for TNBC clinical therapy, it is necessary to investigate the factors regulating cancer progression and develop novel therapies for cancer treatment. Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids, is regulated by cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and various cancer-related signaling pathways. Recently, considerable progress has been made in demonstrating the critical role of lipid metabolism in regulating ferroptosis, indicating potential combinational therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. In this study, by drug combination screen of lipid metabolism compounds with ferroptosis inducers in decreasing TNBC cell viability, we found potent synergy of the CB1 antagonist rimonabant with erastin/(1 S, 3 R)-RSL3 (RSL3) in inhibiting TNBC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo via promoting the levels of lipid peroxides, malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, enhancing intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion and inducing G1 cell cycle arrest. We identified that inhibition of CB1 promoted the effect of erastin/RSL3 on inducing ferroptosis and enhanced their inhibitory effect on tumor growth. Using RNA-Seq, fatty acid analyses and functional assays, we found that CB1 regulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)- and fatty acyl desaturase 2 (FADS2)-dependent fatty acid metabolism via phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways to modulate ferroptosis sensitivity in TNBC cells.

Here, we reported that vanillic acid (VA) exerted potent therapeutic effects on DSS-induced colitis by restoring intestinal epithelium homeostasis via the inhibition of ferroptosis. By the CETSA assay and DARTS assay, we identified carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX, CA9) as the direct target of VA. The binding of VA to CA9 causes insulin-induced gene-2 (INSIG2) to interact with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), rather than SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), leading to the translocation of SCAP-SREBP1 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage into mature SREBP1. The activation of SREBP1 induced by VA then significantly facilitated the transcription of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) to exert an inhibitory effect on ferroptosis. By inhibiting the excessive death of intestinal epithelial cells caused by ferroptosis, VA effectively preserved the integrity of intestinal barrier and prevented the progression of unresolved inflammation.

In recent years, modulating ferroptosis has gained attention as a potential therapeutic approach for tumor suppression. In the current study, retinol saturase (RETSAT) was identified as a significant ferroptosis mediator using a publicly accessible CRISPR/Cas9 screening dataset. RETSAT depletion protected tumor cells from lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell death triggered by various ferroptosis inducers. Furthermore, exogenous supplementation with retinoids, including retinol (the substrate of RETSAT) and its derivatives retinal and retinoic acid, also suppressed ferroptosis, whereas the product of RETSAT, 13, 14-dihydroretinol, failed to do so. As effective radical-trapping antioxidant, retinoids protected the lipid membrane from autoxidation and subsequent fragmentation, thus terminating the cascade of ferroptosis. Pseudotargeted lipidomic analysis identified an association between retinoid regulation of ferroptosis and lipid metabolism. Retinoic acid, but not 13, 14-dihydroretinoic acid, interacted with its nuclear receptor and activated transcription of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, which introduces the first double bond into saturated fatty acid and thus catalyzes the generation of monounsaturated fatty acid, a known ferroptosis suppressor.

De novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis, uptake and suppression of FA oxidation have all been shown to contribute to lipid storage, which is a necessary tumour adaptation rather than a bystander effect. Clinical studies and mechanistic investigations into the roles of different enzymes in FA metabolism pathways have revealed new metabolic vulnerabilities that hold promise for clinical effect. Several metabolic alterations are associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with ccRCC, as lipogenic genes drive tumorigenesis. Enzymes involved in the intrinsic FA metabolism pathway include FA synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, cluster of differentiation 36, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and the perilipin family, and each might be potential therapeutic targets in ccRCC owing to the link between lipid deposition and ccRCC risk. Adipokines and lipid species are potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment monitoring in patients with ccRCC. FA metabolism could potentially be targeted for therapeutic intervention in ccRCC as small-molecule inhibitors targeting the pathway have shown promising results in preclinical models.",

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells acquire resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent cancer cell death induced by SCD1 inhibition.

Nevertheless, its clinical significance and function in bladder cancer (BLCA) remain poorly defined.\nMETHODS: Machine learning algorithms were employed to identify pivotal CCDC genes in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), and a prognostic model was subsequently constructed. Multi-omics data encompassing pan-cancer cohorts, single-cell sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics were integrated to characterize the expression patterns and prognostic significance of Coiled-coil domain-containing 137 (CCDC137), a previously uncharacterized CCDC family member in BLCA. Tissue microarray confirmed CCDC137 abnormal expression in bladder carcinoma specimens. The effect of CCDC137 knockdown on BLCA progression was evaluated through CCK8 assay, clonogenic formation, wound healing, Transwell, and subcutaneous xenograft models. RNA sequencing, quantitative RT-PCR, and western blot were utilized to delineate its regulatory network.\nRESULTS: A prognostic model incorporating 10 CCDC genes was successfully established in the TCGA-BLCA cohort. Then, we found that CCDC137 exhibited pan-cancer overexpression and usually correlation with poor clinical outcomes. Immunohistochemistry further substantiated its dysregulation in bladder carcinoma. Integrated multi-omics analyses suggested associations between CCDC137 expression and a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. CCDC137 knockdown significantly suppressed bladder cancer cell proliferation and migratory capacity in vitro. Correspondingly, subcutaneous xenograft tumor growth was inhibited in vivo. Moreover, decreased expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a key lipid metabolic enzyme, accompanied CCDC137 depletion. These findings collectively suggest a cancer-promoting role for CCDC137 in bladder carcinoma.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic investigation combining multi-omics bioinformatics analyses and experimental validation demonstrates the role of CCDC137 in bladder carcinoma progression, providing novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of BLCA and offering a theoretical foundation for therapeutic targeting of CCDC137 in urothelial malignancies.",

After a 48-hour fast, Acss1K635Q/K635Q mice presented hypothermia and liver aberrations, including enlargement, discoloration, lipid droplet accumulation, and microsteatosis, consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). RNA sequencing analysis suggested dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism, cellular senescence, and hepatic steatosis networks, consistent with NAFLD. Fasted Acss1K635Q/K635Q mouse livers showed increased fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), both associated with NAFLD, and increased carbohydrate response element-binding protein binding to Fasn and Scd1 enhancer regions. Last, liver lipidomics showed elevated ceramide, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and lysophosphatidylcholine, all associated with NAFLD. Thus, we propose that ACSS1-K635-Ac dysregulation leads to aberrant lipid metabolism, cellular senescence, and NAFLD.",

Our findings show that MB expression in mammary epithelial cells promoted fatty acid oxidation while reducing stearyl-CoA desaturase activity for lipogenesis.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent research has shown that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F1 (Adgrf1; also known as GPR110; PGR19; KPG_012; hGPCR36) is an oncogene. The evidence is mainly based on high expression of Adgrf1 in numerous cancer types, and knockdown Adgrf1 can reduce the cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Adgrf1 is, however, mostly expressed in the liver of healthy individuals. The function of Adgrf1 in liver has not been revealed. Interestingly, expression level of hepatic Adgrf1 is dramatically decreased in obese subjects. Here, the research examined whether Adgrf1 has a role in liver metabolism.\nMETHODS: We used recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery system, and antisense oligonucleotide was used to manipulate the hepatic Adgrf1 expression level in diet-induced obese mice to investigate the role of Adgrf1 in hepatic steatosis. The clinical relevance was examined using transcriptome profiling and archived biopsy specimens of liver tissues from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients with different degree of fatty liver.\nRESULTS: The expression of Adgrf1 in the liver was directly correlated to fat content in the livers of both obese mice and NAFLD patients. Stearoyl-coA desaturase 1 (Scd1), a crucial enzyme in hepatic de novo lipogenesis, was identified as a downstream target of Adgrf1 by RNA-sequencing analysis. Treatment with the liver-specific Scd1 inhibitor MK8245 and specific shRNAs against Scd1 in primary hepatocytes improved the hepatic steatosis of Adgrf1-overexpressing mice and lipid profile of hepatocytes, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate Adgrf1 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism through controlling the expression of Scd1. Downregulation of Adgrf1 expression can potentially serve as a protective mechanism to stop the overaccumulation of fat in the liver in obese subjects. Overall, the above findings not only reveal a new mechanism regulating the progression of NAFLD, but also proposed a novel therapeutic approach to combat NAFLD by targeting Adgrf1.\nFUNDING: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81870586), Area of Excellence (AoE/M-707/18), and General Research Fund (15101520) to CMW, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82270941, 81974117) to SJ.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a regulated non-apoptotic cell death process characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This process has recently emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PLs) is necessary for the execution of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is normally suppressed by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols. Some evidence indicates that GPX4 may be a useful target for drug development, yet factors that govern GPX4 inhibitor sensitivity in vivo are poorly understood. We find that pharmacological and genetic loss of GPX4 function was sufficient to induce ferroptosis in multiple adherent (\"2D\") cancer cell cultures. However, reducing GPX4 protein levels did not affect tumor xenograft growth when these cells were implanted in mice. Furthermore, sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition was markedly reduced when cells were cultured as spheroids (\"3D\"). Mechanistically, growth in 3D versus 2D conditions reduced the abundance of PUFA-PLs. 3D culture conditions upregulated the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) biosynthetic gene stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD-derived MUFAs appear to protect against ferroptosis in 3D conditions by displacing PUFAs from phospholipids. Various structurally related long chain MUFAs can inhibit ferroptosis through this PUFA-displacement mechanism. These findings suggest that growth-condition-dependent lipidome remodeling is an important mechanism governing GPX4 inhibitor effects. This resistance mechanism may specifically limit GPX4 inhibitor effectiveness in vivo .",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) poses a serious global health threat, with its progression mechanisms not yet fully understood. While several molecular markers for NAFLD have been developed in recent years, a lack of robust evidence hampers their clinical application. Therefore, identifying novel and potent biomarkers would directly aid in the prediction, prevention, and personalized treatment of NAFLD. We downloaded NAFLD-related datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differential expression analysis and functional analysis were initially conducted. Subsequently, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and multiple machine learning strategies were employed to screen and identify key genes, and the diagnostic value was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. We then explored the relationship between genes and immune cells using transcriptome data and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Finally, we validated our findings in cell and mouse NAFLD models. We obtained 23 overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across three NAFLD datasets. Enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were associated with Apoptosis, Parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion and action, Colorectal cancer, p53 signaling pathway, and Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. After employing machine learning strategies, we identified one gene, pleckstrin homology like domain family A member 1 (PHLDA1), downregulated in NAFLD and showing high diagnostic accuracy. CIBERSORT analysis revealed significant associations of PHLDA1 with various immune cells. Single-cell data analysis demonstrated downregulation of PHLDA1 in NAFLD, with PHLDA1 exhibiting a significant negative correlation with macrophages. Furthermore, we found PHLDA1 to be downregulated in an in vitro hepatic steatosis cell model, and overexpression of PHLDA1 significantly reduced lipid accumulation, as well as the expression of key molecules involved in hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake, such as FASN, SCD-1, and CD36. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) pathway enrichment analysis suggested that PHLDA1 may influence NAFLD progression through pathways such as Cytokine Cytokine Receptor Interaction, Ecm Receptor Interaction, Parkinson's Disease, and Ribosome pathways. Our conclusions were further validated in a mouse model of NAFLD. Our study reveals that PHLDA1 inhibits the progression of NAFLD, as overexpression of PHLDA1 significantly reduces lipid accumulation in cells and markedly decreases the expression of key molecules involved in liver lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake. Therefore, PHLDA1 may emerge as a novel potential target for future prediction, diagnosis, and targeted prevention of NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) are tumors arising from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, and paragangliomas (PGLs) are tumors derived from extra-adrenal sympathetic or parasympathetic paraganglia; these tumors are collectively referred to as PPGL cancer. Treatment for PPGL primarily involves surgical removal of the tumor, and only limited options are available for treatment of the disease once it becomes metastatic. Human carriers of the heterozygous mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) gene are susceptible to the development of PPGL. A physiologically relevant PCC patient-derived cell line hPheo1 was developed, and SDHB_KD cells carrying a stable short hairpin knockdown of SDHB were derived from it. An untargeted metabolomic approach uncovered an overactive polyamine pathway in the SDHB_KD cells that was subsequently fully validated in a large set of human SDHB-mutant PPGL tumor samples. We previously reported that treatment with the polyamine metabolism inhibitor N1,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM) drastically inhibited growth of these PCC-derived cells in culture as well as in xenograft mouse models. Here we explored the mechanisms underlying DENSPM action in hPheo1 and SDHB_KD cells. Specifically, by performing an RNAseq analysis, we have identified gene expression changes associated with DENSPM treatment that broadly interfere with all aspects of lipid metabolism, including fatty acid (FA) synthesis, desaturation, and import/uptake. Furthermore, by performing an untargeted lipidomic liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based analysis we uncovered specific groups of lipids that are dramatically reduced as a result of DENSPM treatment. Specifically, the bulk of plasmanyl ether lipid species that have been recently reported as the major determinants of cancer cell fate are notably decreased. In summary, this work suggests an intersection between active polyamine and lipid pathways in PCC cells.",

Lipid metabolism-targeted therapies decrease the risk of progressing from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to EAC, but the precise lipid metabolic changes and their roles in genotoxicity during EAC development are yet to be established.\nMETHODS: Esophageal biopsies from the normal epithelium (NE), BE, and EAC, were analyzed using concurrent lipidomics and proteomics (n = 30) followed by orthogonal validation on independent samples using RNAseq transcriptomics (n = 22) and immunohistochemistry (IHC, n = 80). The EAC cell line FLO-1 was treated with FADS2 selective inhibitor SC26196, and/or bile acid cocktail, followed by immunofluorescence staining for γH2AX.\nRESULTS: Metabolism-focused Reactome analysis of the proteomics data revealed enrichment of fatty acid metabolism, ketone body metabolism, and biosynthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators in EAC pathogenesis. Lipidomics revealed progressive alterations (NE-BE-EAC) in glycerophospholipid synthesis with decreasing triglycerides and increasing phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingolipid synthesis with decreasing dihydroceramide and increasing ceramides. Furthermore, a progressive increase in lipids with C20 fatty acids and polyunsaturated lipids with ≥4 double bonds were also observed. Integration with transcriptome data identified candidate enzymes for IHC validation: Δ4-Desaturase, Sphingolipid 1 (DEGS1) which desaturates dihydroceramide to ceramide, and Δ5 and Δ6-Desaturases (fatty acid desaturases, FADS1 and FADS2), responsible for polyunsaturation. All three enzymes showed significant increases from BE through dysplasia to EAC, but transcript levels of DEGS1 were decreased suggesting post-translational regulation. Finally, the FADS2 selective inhibitor SC26196 significantly reduced polyunsaturated lipids with three and four double bonds and reduced bile acid-induced DNA double-strand breaks in FLO-1 cells in vitro.\nCONCLUSIONS: Integrated multiomics revealed sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolism rewiring during EAC development. FADS2 inhibition and reduction of the high polyunsaturated lipids effectively protected EAC cells from bile acid-induced DNA damage in vitro, potentially through reduced lipid peroxidation.",

    "abstract": "Apart from the oncometabolite succinate, little studies have appeared on extra-mitochondrial pathways in Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) genetic deficiency. The role of NADH/NAD+ redox status and dependent pathways was recently emphasized. Therein, fatty acid (FA) metabolism data were collected here in 30 patients with a loss of function (LOF) variant in one SDHx gene (either with a pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL) or asymptomatic) and in 22 wild-type SDHx controls (with PPGL or asymptomatic). Blood acylcarnitines in two patients, peroxisomal biomarkers, very long-chain saturated FA (VLCFA), and C20 to C24 n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), in all patients were measured by mass spectrometry. Preliminary data showed elevated even and odd long- and very long-chain acylcarnitines in two patients with a SDHB variant. In the whole series, no abnormalities were observed in biomarkers of peroxisomal β-oxidation (C27-bile acids, VLCFAs and phytanic/pristanic acids) in SDHx patients. However, an increased hexaene to pentaene PUFA ratio ([TetraHexaenoic Acid + DocosaHexaenoic Acid]/[n-3 DocosaPentaenoic Acid + EicosaPentaenoic Acid]) was noticed in patients with SDHC/SDHD variants vs patients with SDHA/SDHB variants or controls, suggesting a higher degree of unsaturation of PUFAs. Within the group with a SDHx variant, Eicosapentaenoate/Tetracosahexaenoate ratio, as an empiric index of shortening/elongation balance, discriminated patients with PPGL from asymptomatic ones. Present findings argue for stimulated elongation of saturated FAs, changes in shortening/elongation balance and desaturation rates of C20-C24 PUFAs in SDH-deficient patients with PPGL. Overall, oxidation of NADH sustained by these pathways might reflect or impact glycolytic NAD+ recycling and hence tumor proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Solute Carriers (SLCs) family is responsible for the transport of a range of nutrients and has been linked to various cancers. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a contributing factor to the recurrence and metastasis of HCC. However, the regulatory genes that govern this process remain unclear. The present study identified SLC35C2 as a crucial factor in maintaining the stem-cell characteristics of HCC cells through CRISPR-dCas9 screening. Further investigation demonstrated that SLC35C2 was significantly elevated in HCC tissues and correlated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients. It is an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. The knockdown and overexpression of SLC35C2 inhibited or promoted stemness in HCC cell. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that SLC35C2 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis in HCC cells. Through RNA-seq and lipidomics analysis, it was found that SLC35C2 regulated lipid reprogramming, particularly triglyceride synthesis. Mechanistically, SLC35C2 stimulated lipogenesis through the up-regulation of SREBP1, ACC, FAS, and SCD-1, thereby increasing lipid accumulation in HCC cells. SLC35C2 interacted with ACSL4, which plays a critical role in lipogenesis, and to protect it from degradation. Inhibition of ACSL4 with PRGL493 can reverse the lipogenesis, stemness and proliferation induced by SLC35C2 overexpression. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the pivotal role of SLC35C2 in stemness and malignant progression in HCC by promoting lipogenesis. These findings suggest that SLC35C2 is a prognostic marker and promising therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",

The endogenous sources of damage contributing to FA phenotypes and the links between FA and metabolic disease remain poorly understood. Here, using mice lacking the Fancd2 gene, encoding a central FA pathway component, we investigated whether the FA pathway protects against metabolic challenges. Fancd2-/- and wildtype (WT) mice were fed a standard diet (SD), a diet enriched in fat, cholesterol, and cholic acid (Paigen diet), or a diet enriched in lipid alone (high-fat diet (HFD)). Fancd2-/- mice developed hepatobiliary disease and exhibited decreased survival when fed a Paigen diet but not a HFD. Male Paigen diet-fed mice lacking Fancd2 had significant biliary hyperplasia, increased serum bile acid concentration, and increased hepatic pathology. In contrast, female mice were similarly impacted by Paigen diet feeding regardless of Fancd2 status. Upon Paigen diet challenge, male Fancd2-/- mice had altered expression of genes encoding hepatic bile acid transporters and cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism proteins, including Scp2/x, Abcg5/8, Abca1, Ldlr, Srebf1, and Scd-1 Untargeted lipidomic profiling in liver tissue revealed 132 lipid species, including sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and glycerolipids, that differed significantly in abundance depending on Fancd2 status in male mice.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exosome-enriched small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are nanosized organelles known to participate in long distance communication between cells, including in the skin. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease for which filaggrin (FLG) gene mutations are the strongest genetic risk factor. Filaggrin insufficiency affects multiple cellular function, but it is unclear if sEV-mediated cellular communication originating from the affected keratinocytes is also altered, and if this influences peptide and lipid antigen presentation to T cells in the skin.\nMETHODS: Available mRNA and protein expression datasets from filaggrin-insufficient keratinocytes (shFLG), organotypic models and AD skin were used for gene ontology analysis with FunRich tool. sEVs secreted by shFLG and control shC cells were isolated from conditioned media by differential centrifugation. Mass spectrometry was carried out for lipidomic and proteomic profiling of the cells and sEVs. T cell responses to protein, peptide, CD1a lipid antigens, as well as phospholipase A2-digested or intact sEVs were measured by ELISpot and ELISA.\nRESULTS: Data analysis revealed extensive remodeling of the sEV compartment in filaggrin insufficient keratinocytes, 3D models and the AD skin. Lipidomic profiles of shFLGsEV showed a reduction in the long chain (LCFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; permissive CD1a ligands) and increased content of the bulky headgroup sphingolipids (non-permissive ligands). This resulted in a reduction of CD1a-mediated interferon-γ T cell responses to the lipids liberated from shFLG-generated sEVs in comparison to those induced by sEVs from control cells, and an increase in interleukin 13 secretion. The altered sEV lipidome reflected a generalized alteration in the cellular lipidome in filaggrin-insufficient cells and the skin of AD patients, resulting from a downregulation of key enzymes implicated in fatty acid elongation and desaturation, i.e., enzymes of the ACSL, ELOVL and FADS family.\nDISCUSSION: We determined that sEVs constitute a source of antigens suitable for CD1a-mediated presentation to T cells. Lipids enclosed within the sEVs secreted on the background of filaggrin insufficiency contribute to allergic inflammation by reducing type 1 responses and inducing a type 2 bias from CD1a-restricted T cells, thus likely perpetuating allergic inflammation in the skin.",

Here, the interplay between the obesity-derived adipokine leptin (LEP) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD), a critical enzyme in fatty acid (FA) metabolism, was explored. While Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database analysis reported a significant protein-protein interaction between LEP and SCD, functional processing of the differentially expressed genes in LEP-treated breast cancer cells revealed a critical involvement of SCD in the interactome of deregulated proteins. Kaplan-Meier analyses linked LEP/SCD expression to poorer recurrence-free survival in patients with estrogen receptor α luminal A-like breast cancer. Functional studies demonstrated that LEP up-regulated SCD expression in luminal A-like breast cancer cells through LEP receptor-mediated signaling. Lipidomic profiling showed that SCD inhibition using MF-438 reduced LEP-induced FA desaturation, characterized by a shift from saturated to monounsaturated FAs. SCD inhibition also abolished the LEP-mediated mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Additionally, LEP-induced oncogenic features, including enhanced growth and motility, were counteracted by pharmacologic/genetic SCD blockade, confirming SCD's role in leptin's protumorigenic effects.

    "abstract": "There have been increases in the incidence of obesity in Lebanon over the past few decades. Fatty acid intake and metabolism have been postulated to influence obesity, but few epidemiological studies have been conducted. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between serum fatty acid levels and indicators of obesity in a cross-sectional study nested within a cohort of 501 Lebanese adults residing in Greater Beirut. A total of 395 available serum samples (129 men, 266 women) were profiled for phospholipid fatty acid composition. Spearman correlation coefficients adjusted for relevant confounders and corrected for multiple testing were calculated between serum fatty acids, desaturation indices, and indicators of adiposity (body mass index (BMI) and waist). BMI was significantly positively correlated with saturated fatty acids in men (r = 0.40, p < 0.0001, q < 0.0001) and women (r = 0.33, p < 0.0001, q < 0.0001). BMI was significantly positively correlated with monounsaturated fatty acid palmitoleic acid in women (r = 0.15, p = 0.01, q = 0.03). This study suggests that high blood levels of some saturated fatty acids and the monounsaturated fatty acid palmitoleic acid, likely derived from both dietary intakes of saturated fatty acids and endogenous lipogenesis, may have been associated with adiposity in the Lebanese population. The causality of these associations needs to be explored in experimental settings.",

Aberrant activation of FGFR3 via overexpression or mutation is a frequent feature of bladder cancer; however, its molecular and cellular consequences and functional relevance to carcinogenesis are not well understood. Through transcriptional profiling of bladder carcinoma cells subjected to short hairpin RNA knockdown of FGFR3, we identified a gene-signature linking FGFR3 signaling with de novo sterol and lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. We found that FGFR3 signaling promotes the cleavage and activation of the master transcriptional regulator of lipogenesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP1/SREBF1), in a PI3K-mTORC1-dependent fashion. In turn, SREBP1 regulates the expression of key lipogenic enzymes, including stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1/SCD). SCD1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids and is crucial for lipid homeostasis. In human bladder cancer cell lines expressing constitutively active FGFR3, knockdown of SCD1 by siRNA markedly attenuated cell-cycle progression, reduced proliferation, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inducible knockdown of SCD1 in a bladder cancer xenograft model substantially inhibited tumor progression. Pharmacologic inhibition of SCD1 blocked fatty acid desaturation and also exerted antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of FGFR3 in regulating lipid metabolism to maintain tumor growth and survival, and also identify SCD1 as a potential therapeutic target for FGFR3-driven bladder cancer.",

Actually, inadequate dietary habits together with physical inactivity are primary determinants of obesity and cancer risk. Changes in lipid metabolism play a crucial role in different types of cancer and key enzymes involved in lipid-metabolic pathways, such as stearoyl-coA-desaturase 1 (SCD-1), are differentially expressed in normal and cancer tissues.\nMETHODS: Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were analyzed by Winfood software. FA were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography in visceral AT samples. Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as precursor FA/product FA ratio. Desaturase gene expressions were evaluated by RT-qPCR.\nRESULTS: Lean and obese CRC subjects showed inadequate dietary habits. In particular, lean CRC subjects showed increase in the intake of saturated FA, specifically palmitic (p = 0.0042) and stearic acid (p = 0.0091), and a corresponding reduction of monounsaturated FA consumption, in particular oleic acid (p = 0.002) with respect to lean without CRC. Estimated SCD-1 activity in AT was increased in all the groups vs lean without CRC (pANOVA = 0.029).\nCONCLUSIONS: Unhealthy eating habits, characterizing obese and CRC subjects, may influence the visceral AT profile and contribute to the alteration of the metabolic pathways. The quality of the diet, other than the quantity, can have a main role in the establishment of inflammatory microenvironment and in metabolic changes favouring CRC.",

Partial least-square discriminant analysis indicated that changes in the levels of these membrane lipids were closely correlated with the types of breast cell lines. Elevated levels of polyunsaturated lipids in MCF-10 A cells relative to six breast cancer cells and in BT-20 cells relative to other breast cancer cell lines were detected.

Integrated analysis of genomic, proteomic, post-translational modification and metabolomic data on 99 treatment-naive GBMs provides insights to GBM biology. We identify key phosphorylation events (e.g., phosphorylated PTPN11 and PLCG1) as potential switches mediating oncogenic pathway activation, as well as potential targets for EGFR-, TP53-, and RB1-altered tumors. Immune subtypes with distinct immune cell types are discovered using bulk omics methodologies, validated by snRNA-seq, and correlated with specific expression and histone acetylation patterns. Histone H2B acetylation in classical-like and immune-low GBM is driven largely by BRDs, CREBBP, and EP300. Integrated metabolomic and proteomic data identify specific lipid distributions across subtypes and distinct global metabolic changes in IDH-mutated tumors. This work highlights biological relationships that could contribute to stratification of GBM patients for more effective treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolism reprogramming plays a vital role in glioblastoma (GBM) progression and recurrence by producing enough energy for highly proliferating tumor cells. In addition, metabolic reprogramming is crucial for tumor growth and immune-escape mechanisms. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and EGFR-vIII mutation are often detected in GBM cells, contributing to the malignant behavior. This study aimed to investigate the functional role of the EGFR pathway on fatty acid metabolism remodeling and energy generation.\nMETHODS: Clinical GBM specimens were selected for single-cell RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis. A metabolism-associated RTK-fatty acid-gene signature was constructed and verified. MK-2206 and MK-803 were utilized to block the RTK pathway and mevalonate pathway induced abnormal metabolism. Energy metabolism in GBM with activated EGFR pathway was monitored. The antitumor effect of Osimertinib and Atorvastatin assisted by temozolomide (TMZ) was analyzed by an intracranial tumor model in vivo.\nRESULTS: GBM with high EGFR expression had characteristics of lipid remodeling and maintaining high cholesterol levels, supported by the single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics of clinical GBM samples. Inhibition of the EGFR/AKT and mevalonate pathways could remodel energy metabolism by repressing the tricarboxylic acid cycle and modulating ATP production. Mechanistically, the EGFR/AKT pathway upregulated the expressions of acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 3 (ACSS3), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3 (ACSL3), and long-chain fatty acid elongation-related gene ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2 (ELOVL2) in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway reduced the EGFR level on the cell membranes, thereby affecting the signal transduction of the EGFR/AKT pathway. Therefore, targeting the EGFR/AKT and mevalonate pathways enhanced the antitumor effect of TMZ in GBM cells and animal models.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings not only uncovered the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in EGFR-activated GBM but also provided a combinatorial therapeutic strategy for clinical GBM management.",

Manipulating cholesterol efflux with apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), a cholesterol reverse transporter, restores TAM phagocytosis and reactivates TAM-T cell antitumor immunity.

In continuation of previous work, we demonstrate that pimozide and loperamide trigger an ATG5- and ATG7 (autophagy related 5 and 7)-dependent type of cell death that is significantly reduced with cathepsin inhibitors and the lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger α-tocopherol in MZ-54 GBM cells. Global proteomic analysis after treatment with both drugs also revealed an increase of proteins related to lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes. These changes were accompanied by a massive accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the lysosomal compartment, indicative of impaired lipid transport/degradation. In line with these observations, pimozide and loperamide treatment were associated with a pronounced increase of bioactive sphingolipids including ceramides, glucosylceramides and sphingoid bases measured by targeted lipidomic analysis. Furthermore, pimozide and loperamide inhibited the activity of SMPD1/ASM (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1) and promoted induction of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), as well as release of CTSB (cathepsin B) into the cytosol in MZ-54 wild-type (WT) cells. Whereas LMP and cell death were significantly attenuated in ATG5 and ATG7 knockout (KO) cells, both events were enhanced by depletion of the lysophagy receptor VCP (valosin containing protein), supporting a pro-survival function of lysophagy under these conditions. Collectively, our data suggest that pimozide and loperamide-driven autophagy and lipotoxicity synergize to induce LMP and cell death. The results also support the notion that simultaneous overactivation of autophagy and induction of LMP represents a promising approach for the treatment of GBM.Abbreviations: ACD: autophagic cell death; AKT1: AKT serine/threonine kinase 1; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATG14: autophagy related 14; CERS1: ceramide synthase 1; CTSB: cathepsin B; CYBB/NOX2: cytochrome b-245 beta chain; ER: endoplasmatic reticulum; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GBM: glioblastoma; GO: gene ontology; HTR7/5-HT7: 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7; KD: knockdown; KO: knockout; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LAP: LC3-associated phagocytosis; LMP: lysosomal membrane permeabilization; MAP1LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; RB1CC1: RB1 inducible coiled-coil 1; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RPS6: ribosomal protein S6; SMPD1/ASM: sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1; VCP/p97: valosin containing protein; WT: wild-type.",

    "abstract": "Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a prevalent malignant tumor of the urinary system. While tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently the first-line treatments for advanced/metastatic ccRCC, patients often develop resistance after TKI therapy. Lipid metabolic reprogramming, a hallmark of tumor progression, contributes to acquired drug resistance in various malignant tumors. Mitophagy, a process that maintains mitochondrial homeostasis, aids tumor cells in adapting to microenvironmental changes and consequently developing drug resistance. Solute carrier family 27 member 3 (SLC27A3), highly expressed in lipid-rich tumors like ccRCC, has been associated with poor prognosis. However, the impact of SLC27A3 and the transcription factor complex containing STAT2 on lipid metabolic reprogramming, mitophagy in ccRCC, and their role in TKI resistance remain unexplored. Methods: 786-O to pazopanib resistance was induced by gradient increase of concentration, and the genes related to lipid metabolism were screened by RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics was used to analyze the differential expression of SLC27A3 and its effect on patient prognosis, and to predict the activated pathway in pazopanib-resistant cells. Lipid droplets (LDs) were detected by Red Oil O and BODIPY probe. Micro-targeted lipidomic of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and lipid metabolomics were performed to screen potential metabolites of SLC27A3. The differential expression of SLC27A3 was detected in clinical samples. The differential expression of SLC27A3 and its effect on drug resistance of ccRCC tumor were detected in vitro and in vivo. Mitophagy was detected by electron microscopy, Mtphagy probe, and Western blot. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected by JC-1 and DCF probes. The binding site of the transcription factor complex to the SLC27A3 promoter was detected by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Results: SLC27A3, highly expressed in lipid-rich tumors such as ccRCC and glioblastoma, predicts poor prognosis. SLC27A3 expression level also increased in pazopanib-resistant 786-O cells (786-O-PR) with more LD accumulation compared to parental cells. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis from RNA sequencing showed that PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway was enriched in 786-O-PR. Knockdown of SLC27A3 markedly suppressed LD accumulation and mitophagy, and overcame pazopanib resistance in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SLC27A3 functions as an acyl-CoA ligase catalyzing the formation of acyl-CoA, which refers to fatty acid oxidation accompanied by ROS production and synthesis of lipid. Overproduced acyl-CoA oxidation in mitochondria resulted in MMP decrease and amounts of ROS production, subsequently triggering PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Moreover, mitophagy inhibition led to more ROS accumulation and cell death, indicating that mitophagy can keep ROS at an appropriate level by negative feedback. Mitophagy, simultaneously, prevented fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria by consuming CPT1A, forcing synthesis of triglycerides and cholesterol esters stored in LDs by transforming acyl-CoA, to support ccRCC progression. Besides, we found that STAT2 expression was positively correlated to SLC27A3. Transcriptional factor complex containing STAT2 could bind to the promoter of SLC27A3 mRNA to promote SLC27A3 transcription proved by dual-luciferase reporter assay, which also regulated LD metabolism and activated mitophagy during pazopanib resistance. Conclusion: SLC27A3 is up-regulated in pazopanib-resistant ccRCC and predicts poor prognosis. High expression of SLC27A3 produces excessive metabolites of various long-chain fatty acyl-CoA (12:0-, 16:0-, 17:0-, 20:3-CoA) to enter mitochondria for β-oxidation and produce amounts of ROS activating mitophagy. Subsequent mitophagy/ROS negative feedback controls ROS homeostasis and consumes CPT1A protein within mitochondria to suppress fatty acid β-oxidation, forcing acyl-CoA storage in LDs, mediating pazopanib resistance in ccRCC. Furthermore, STAT2 was identified as a core component of a potential upstream transcriptional factor complex for SLC27A3. Our findings shed new light on the underlying mechanism of SLC27A3 in ccRCC TKI resistance, which may provide a novel therapeutic target for the management of ccRCC.",

    "abstract": "Rationale: Glioblastoma (GBM) displays a complex metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is one of the central mediators of cell metabolism and signaling. GBM cells generate ATP by glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) through the breaking-down of pyruvate or fatty acids to meet the growing energy demand of cancer cells. Therefore, it's urgent to develop novel treatments targeting energy metabolism to hinder tumor cell proliferation in GBM. Methods: Non-targeted metabolomic profiling analysis was utilized to evaluate cell metabolic reprogramming using a small molecule inhibitor (SMI) EPIC-0412 treatment. Cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the total proton efflux rate (PER), as well as ATP concentration, were tracked to study metabolic responses to specifically targeted inhibitors, including EPIC-0412, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), and 2 deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Cancer cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 measurements and colony formation assay. Additionally, flow cytometry, immunoblotting (IB), and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses were performed with GBM cells to understand their tumorigenic properties under treatments. Finally, the anticancer effects of this combination therapy were evaluated in the GBM mouse model by convection-enhanced delivery (CED). Results: We found that SMI EPIC-0412 could effectively perturb the TCA cycle, which participated in the combination therapy of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-inhibitor AACOCF3, and hexokinase II (HK2)-inhibitor 2-DG to disrupt the GBM energy metabolism for targeted metabolic treatments. ATP production was significantly declined in glioma cells when treated with monotherapy (EPIC-0412 or AACOCF3), dual therapy (EPIC-0412 + AACOCF3), or triple therapy (EPIC-0412 + AACOCF3 +2-DG) regimen. Our experiments revealed that these therapies hindered glioma cell proliferation and growth, leading to the reduction in ATP production and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. We demonstrated that the combination therapy effectively extended the survival of cerebral tumor-bearing mice. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the TCA-phospholipid-glycolysis metabolism axis can be blocked by specific inhibitors that significantly disrupt the tumor energy metabolism and suppress tumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that targeting ATP synthesis inhibition in cancer cells might be an attractive therapeutic avenue in GBM management.",

    "abstract": "Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are dietary components with a chain length ranging from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. MCFA can cross the blood-brain barrier and in the brain can be oxidized through mitochondrial β-oxidation. As components of ketogenic diets, MCFA have demonstrated beneficial effects on different brain diseases, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, drug-resistant epilepsy, diabetes, and cancer. Despite the interest in MCFA effects, not much information is available about MCFA metabolism in the brain. In this study, with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach, coupled with multivariate data analyses, we followed the metabolic changes of U87MG glioblastoma cells after the addition of octanoic (C8), or decanoic (C10) acids for 24 h. Our analysis highlighted significant differences in the metabolism of U87MG cells after the addition of C8 or C10 and identified several metabolites whose amount changed between the two groups of treated cells. Overall, metabolic pathway analyses suggested the citric acid cycle, Warburg effect, glutamine/glutamate metabolism, and ketone body metabolism as pathways influenced by C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells. Our data demonstrated that, while C8 affected mitochondrial metabolism resulting in increased ketone body production, C10 mainly influenced cytosolic pathways by stimulating fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, glutamine might be the main substrate to support fatty acids synthesis in C10-treated cells. In conclusion, we identified a metabolic signature associated with C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells that can be used to decipher metabolic responses of glioblastoma cells to MCFA treatment.",

The adverse outcomes are worsened by high rates of treatment discontinuation, caused by the severe side effects of temozolomide (TMZ), the reference treatment. Therefore, understanding TMZ's effects on GBM and healthy brain tissue could reveal new approaches to address chemotherapy side effects. In this context, we have previously demonstrated the membrane lipidome is highly cell type-specific and very sensitive to pathophysiological states. However, little remains known as to how membrane lipids participate in GBM onset and progression. Hence, we employed an ex vivo model to assess the impact of TMZ treatment on healthy and GBM lipidome, which was established through imaging mass spectrometry techniques. This approach revealed that bioactive lipid metabolic hubs (phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen species) were altered in healthy brain tissue treated with TMZ. To better understand these changes, we interrogated RNA expression and DNA methylation datasets of the Cancer Genome Atlas database. The results enabled GBM subtypes and patient survival to be linked with the expression of enzymes accounting for the observed lipidome, thus proving that exploring the lipid changes could reveal promising therapeutic approaches for GBM, and ways to ameliorate TMZ side effects.",

Thus, more studies are needed to elucidate the resistance mechanisms. In the current study, we investigated the relationship among the three important phenotypes, namely TMZ-resistance, cell shape and lipid metabolism, in GBM cells. We first observed the distinct difference in cell shapes between TMZ-sensitive (U87) and resistant (U87R) GBM cells. We then conducted NMR-based lipid metabolomics, which revealed a significant increase in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis as well as lower lipid unsaturation in U87R cells. Consistent with the lipid changes, U87R cells exhibited significantly lower membrane fluidity. The transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that lipid synthesis pathways through SREBP were upregulated in U87R cells, which was confirmed at the protein level. Fatostatin, an SREBP inhibitor, and other lipid pathway inhibitors (C75, TOFA) exhibited similar or more potent inhibition on U87R cells compared to sensitive U87 cells. The lower lipid unsaturation ratio, membrane fluidity and higher fatostatin sensitivity were all recapitulated in patient-derived TMZ-resistant primary cells. The observed ternary relationship among cell shape, lipid composition, and TMZ-resistance may be applicable to other drug-resistance cases. SREBP and fatostatin are suggested as a promising target-therapeutic agent pair for drug-resistant glioblastoma.",

Therefore, researchers look to using MSI-mediated spatial metabolomics to further study the altered metabolites in cancer patients. In this review, we examined the two most commonly used spatial metabolomics techniques, MALDI-MSI and DESI-MSI, and some recent highlights of their applications in cancer studies. We also described AFADESI-MSI as a recent variation from the DESI-MSI and compare it with the two major techniques. Specifically, we discussed spatial metabolomics results in four types of heterogeneous malignancies, including breast cancer, esophageal cancer, glioblastoma and lung cancer. Multiple studies have effectively classified cancer tissue subtypes using altered metabolites information. In addition, distribution trends of key metabolites such as fatty acids, high-energy phosphate compounds, and antioxidants were identified.

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. Its etiology remains unknown in most cases. Glioblastoma pathogenesis consists of a progressive infiltration of the white matter by tumoral cells leading to progressive neurological deficit, epilepsy, and/or intracranial hypertension.

Given this aggressive prognosis, there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of glioblastoma to unveil new diagnostic strategies and therapeutic targets through a deeper understanding of its biology.

    "abstract": "Aims: Targeting tumor metabolism may improve the outcomes for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). To further preclinical efforts targeting metabolism in GBM, we tested the hypothesis that brain tumors can be stratified into distinct metabolic groups with different patient outcomes. Therefore, to determine if tumor metabolites relate to patient survival, we profiled the metabolomes of human gliomas and correlated metabolic information with clinical data. Results: We found that isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) GBMs are metabolically distinguishable from IDH mutated (IDHmut) astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Survival of patients with IDHmut gliomas was expectedly more favorable than those with IDHwt GBM, and metabolic signatures can stratify IDHwt GBMs subtypes with varying prognoses. Patients whose GBMs were enriched in amino acids had improved survival, while those whose tumors were enriched for nucleotides, redox molecules, and lipid metabolites fared more poorly. These findings were recapitulated in validation cohorts using both metabolomic and transcriptomic data. Innovation: Our results suggest the existence of metabolic subtypes of GBM with differing prognoses, and further support the concept that metabolism may drive the aggressiveness of human gliomas. Conclusions: Our data show that metabolic signatures of human gliomas can inform patient survival.

The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling.\nMETHODS: A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence.\nRESULTS: Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.",

In this study, we performed targeted metabolomic analysis of CSF from n = 31 patients with GBM and n = 13 individuals with non-neoplastic conditions (controls), by mass spectrometry. Hierarchical clustering and sparse partial least square-discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) revealed differences in CSF metabolites between GBM and control CSF, including metabolites associated with fatty acid oxidation and the gut microbiome (i.e., carnitine, 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine, shikimate, aminobutanal, uridine, N-acetylputrescine, and farnesyl diphosphate).

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) employs various strategies to resist therapy, resulting in poor patient survival. A key aspect of its survival mechanisms lies in metabolic regulation, maintaining rapid growth and evading cell death. Recent studies revealed the connection between therapy resistance and ferroptosis, a lipid peroxidation-dependent cell death mechanism triggered by metabolic dysfunction. Our aim was to identify novel regulators of therapy resistance in GBM cells. We conducted a comprehensive analysis combining RNA-sequencing data from a panel of human GBM cell models and TCGA GBM patient datasets. We focused on the top-12 differentially expressed gene candidates associated with poor survival in GBM patients and performed an RNA interference-mediated screen to uncover the radiochemosensitizing potential of these molecules and their impact on metabolic activity, DNA damage, autophagy, and apoptosis. We identified exostosin glycosyltransferase 2 (EXT2), an enzyme previously described in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, as the most promising candidate. EXT2 depletion elicited reduced cell viability and proliferation as well as radiochemosensitization in various GBM cell models. Mechanistically, we explored EXT2 function by conducting untargeted and targeted metabolomics and detected that EXT2-depleted GBM cells exhibit a differential abundance of metabolites belonging to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism. Considering these metabolic changes, we determined lipid peroxidation and found that the diminished antioxidant capacity resulting from decreased levels of metabolites in the transsulfuration pathway induces ferroptosis. Moreover, modifications of specific SAM and transsulfuration metabolism associated enzymes revealed a prosurvival and ferroptosis-reducing function when EXT2 is depleted. Collectively, our results uncover a novel role of EXT2 in GBM cell survival and response to X-ray radiation, which is controlled by modulation of ferroptosis. These findings expand our understanding of how GBM cells respond to radio(chemo)therapy and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches.",

Genomic investigations have provided a greater understanding of molecular heterogeneity in glioblastoma, yet there are still no curative treatments, and the prognosis has remained unchanged. The aggressive nature of glioblastoma is attributed to the heterogeneity in tumor cell subpopulations and aberrant microvascular proliferation. Ganglioside-directed immunotherapy and membrane lipid therapy have shown efficacy in the treatment of glioblastoma. To truly harness these novel therapeutics and develop a regimen that improves clinical outcome, a greater understanding of the altered lipidomic profiles within the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment is urgently needed. In this work, high resolution mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to investigate lipid heterogeneity in human glioblastoma samples. Data presented offers the first insight into the histology-specific accumulation of lipids involved in cell metabolism and signaling.

Previously, we showed that unlike astrocytes, glioblastoma cells do not downregulate cholesterol synthesis when plated at high density. In this report, we show that high cell density induces ABCA1 expression in glioblastoma cells, enabling them to get rid of excess cholesterol generated by an activated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Because oxysterols are agonists for Liver X Receptors (LXRs), we investigated whether increased cholesterol activates LXRs to maintain cholesterol homeostasis in highly-dense glioblastoma cells. We observed that dense cells had increased oxysterols, which activated LXRβ to upregulate ABCA1. Cells with CRISPR-mediated knockdown of LXRβ, but not ABCA1, had decreased cell cycle progression and cell survival, and decreased feedback repression of the mevalonate pathway in densely-plated glioma cells. LXRβ gene expression poorly correlates with ABCA1 in glioblastoma patients, and expression of each gene correlates with poor patient prognosis in different prognostic subtypes. Finally, gene expression and lipidomics analyses cells revealed that LXRβ regulates the expression of immune response gene sets and lipids known to be involved in immune modulation.

Most of their impact comes via the repression of a network of oncogenic transcription factors. We conducted a high-throughput functional siRNA screen in glioblastoma cells and identify E74 like ETS transcription factor 4 (ELF4) as the leading contributor to oncogenic phenotypes.\nMETHODS: In vitro and in vivo assays were used to assess ELF4 impact on cancer phenotypes. We characterized ELF4's mechanism of action via genomic and lipidomic analyses. A MAPK reporter assay verified ELF4's impact on MAPK signaling, and qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to corroborate ELF4 regulatory role on most relevant target genes.\nRESULTS: ELF4 knockdown resulted in significant proliferation delay and apoptosis in GBM cells and long-term growth delay and morphological changes in glioma stem cells (GSCs). Transcriptomic analyses revealed that ELF4 controls two interlinked pathways: 1) Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and 2) Lipid dynamics. ELF4 modulation directly affected receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity was dependent upon ELF4 levels. Furthermore, shotgun lipidomics revealed that ELF4 depletion disrupted several phospholipid classes, highlighting ELF4's importance in lipid homeostasis.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found that ELF4 is critical for the GBM cell identity by controlling genes of two dependent pathways: RTK signaling (SRC, PTK2B, and TNK2) and lipid dynamics (LRP1, APOE, ABCA7, PLA2G6, and PITPNM2).

We show that even at an early stage (6 and 12 h) myxoma infection causes profound changes in cancer cell metabolism spanning several important pathways such as the citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism.

A salient question is whether low doses of ceramide induce neuronal differentiation without interfering with sphingolipid metabolism and whether high doses can be used in glioblastoma for their cytotoxic effect. Here, we examined the effect of a high dose of ceramide (13 µM) on HN9.10e cells. Interestingly, 13 µM ceramide induced an immediate increase in cell viability, followed by an increase in the number of mitochondria. Microscopic and morphometric analysis revealed a decrease in the number of differentiated cells with 13 µM compared to 0.1 µM but with longer neurites. Furthermore, the lipidomic study demonstrated an increase in the formation of medium-long-chain ceramide and sphingomyelin species and sphingosine 1 phosphate. Sphingolipid modification correlated with SMPD3, ASAH2, and SPHK2 gene expression coding for neutral sphingomyenase 2, ceramidase 2, and sphingosine kinase 2, respectively. Overall, our data show that the variety of responses to ceramide of the same cell type is dependent on the concentration used.

Particularly, the role of Sp1 in metabolic reprogramming for drug resistance remains unknown.\nMETHODS: RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry were used to analyze gene expression and metabolites amounts in paired GBM specimens (primary vs. recurrent) and in paired GBM cells (sensitive vs. resistant). ω-3/6 fatty acid and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in GBM patients were analyzed by targeted metabolome. Mitochondrial functions were determined by Seahorse XF Mito Stress Test, RNA-Seq, metabolome and substrate utilization for producing ATP. Therapeutic options targeting prostaglandin (PG) E2 in TMZ-resistant GBM were validated in vitro and in vivo.\nRESULTS: Among the metabolic pathways, Sp1 increased the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 expression and PGE2 production in TMZ-resistant GBM. Mitochondrial genes and metabolites were obviously increased by PGE2, and these characteristics were required for developing resistance in GBM cells. For inducing TMZ resistance, PGE2 activated mitochondrial functions, including fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle progression, through PGE2 receptors, E-type prostanoid (EP)1 and EP3. Additionally, EP1 antagonist ONO-8713 inhibited the survival of TMZ-resistant GBM synergistically with TMZ.\nCONCLUSION: Sp1-regulated PGE2 production activates FAO and TCA cycle in mitochondria, through EP1 and EP3 receptors, resulting in TMZ resistance in GBM. These results will provide us a new strategy to attenuate drug resistance or to re-sensitize recurred GBM.",

Accumulating data in the past decade clearly showed that deregulation of PC expression is associated with type 2 diabetes in humans, while targeted inhibition of PC expression in a mouse model reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity in diet-induced type 2 diabetes.

The unmethylated promoter area of 6-O-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) is a significant biomarker for recognizing a subset of glioblastoma that is resistant to chemotherapy. Here we identified MGMT methylation can also work as a specific biomarker to classify the lipid metabolism patterns between methylated and unmethylated glioblastoma and verify the potential novel therapeutic strategy for unmethylated MGMT glioblastoma.\nMETHODS: Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer has been applied for non-targeted metabolome and targeted lipidomic profiling to explore the metabolism pattern correlated with MGMT promoter methylation. Transcriptome has been performed to explore the biological differences and the potential mechanism of lipid metabolism in glioblastoma samples. In vivo and ex vivo assays were performed to verify the anti-tumor activity of atorvastatin in the administration of glioblastoma.\nRESULTS: Multi-omics assay has described a significant difference in lipid metabolism between MGMT methylated and unmethylated glioblastoma. Longer and unsaturated fatty acyls were found enriched in MGMT-UM tumors. Lipid droplets have been revealed remarkably decreased in MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma. In vivo and ex vivo assays revealed that atorvastatin and also together with temozolomide showed significant anti-tumor activity, and atorvastatin alone was able to achieve better survival and living conditions for tumor-hosting mice.\nCONCLUSIONS: MGMT promoter methylation status might be a well-performed biomarker of lipid metabolism in glioblastoma.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumor in the central nervous system. GBM patients have a very low 5-year survival rate and most of them died within 1 year. Conventional histopathological examination for GBM diagnosis is complicated and time-consuming, which always blocks the development of more precise and effective treatments in resection operation. Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) is a MS technique in clinical medicine research, which combines the common diathermy device with MS to acquire the lipid profiles of tissue specimens for lipidomic analysis and real-time tumor diagnosis. In this study, the REIMS method employing bipolar forceps was optimized and validated for high-throughput lipidomics and diagnosis of GBM for the first time. Total 42 lipid metabolites were tentatively identified and 12 out of 13 lipid biomarkers showed higher intensities in GBM, which were consistent with previous studies. After this, a statistic model was built with the lipidomic data for the diagnosis of GBM tumor in real-time.

This increase is driven primarily by the growing burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and has occurred despite the identification of cigarette smoking as the major risk factor for the disease more than 50 years ago. Many factors have contributed to what must now be considered a public health emergency: failure to limit the sale and consumption of tobacco products, unchecked exposure to environmental pollutants across the life course, and the ageing of the global population (partly as a result of improved outcomes for other conditions). Additionally, despite the heterogeneity of COPD, diagnostic approaches have not changed in decades and rely almost exclusively on post-bronchodilator spirometry, which is insensitive for early pathological changes, underused, often misinterpreted, and not predictive of symptoms. Furthermore, guidelines recommend only simplistic disease classification strategies, resulting in the same therapeutic approach for patients with widely differing conditions that are almost certainly driven by variable pathophysiological mechanisms. And, compared with other diseases with similar or less morbidity and mortality, the investment of financial and intellectual resources from both the public and private sector to advance understanding of COPD, reduce exposure to known risks, and develop new therapeutics has been woefully inadequate.",

Four factors play vital roles in acne pathophysiology: hyperseborrhea and dysseborrhea, altered keratinization of the pilosebaceous duct, Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) and inflammation. The main hormones responsible for the development of acne vulgaris include androgens, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1. Other factors involved in this process are corticotropin-releasing hormone, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and substance P. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway and nuclear factor kappa B pathway participate in the modulation of sebocyte, keratinocyte and inflammatory cell (e.g. lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils) activity. Among all the triggers and pathways mentioned above, IGF-1-induced PI3K/Akt/Forkhead box protein O1/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 pathway is the most important signaling responsible for acne pathogenesis. Commonly used anti-acne agents include retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics and hormonal agents (e.g. spironolactone, combination oral contraceptive and flutamide). New approaches including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ modifier, melanocortin receptor antagonists, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, metformin, olumacostat glasaretil, stearoyl-CoA desaturase inhibitor omiganan pentahydrochloride, KDPT, afamelanotide, apremilast and biologics have been developed as promising treatments for acne vulgaris. Although these anti-acne agents have various pharmacological effects against the diverse pathogenesis of acne, all of them have a synergistic mode of action, the attenuation of Akt/mTORC1 signaling and enhancement of p53 signal transduction. In addition to drug therapy, diet with no hyperglycemic carbohydrates, no milk and dairy products is also beneficial for treatment of acne.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) is a chronic liver disease affecting over a billion individuals worldwide. MASLD can gradually develop into more severe liver pathologies, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, and liver malignancy. Notably, although being a global health problem, there are very limited therapeutic options against MASLD and its related diseases. While a thyroid hormone receptor agonist (resmetirom) is recently approved for MASH treatment, other efforts to control these diseases remain unsatisfactory. Given the projected rise in MASLD and MASH incidence, it is urgent to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies against these prevalent liver diseases. In this article, the pathogenic mechanisms of MASLD and MASH, including insulin resistance, dysregulated nuclear receptor signaling, and genetic risk factors (eg, patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 and hydroxysteroid 17-β dehydrogenase-13), are introduced. Various therapeutic interventions against MASH are then explored, including approved medication (resmetirom), drugs that are currently in clinical trials (eg, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, fibroblast growth factor 21 analog, and PPAR agonist), and those failed in previous trials (eg, obeticholic acid and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 antagonist). Moreover, given that the role of gut microbes in MASLD is increasingly acknowledged, alterations in the gut microbiota and microbial mechanisms in MASLD development are elucidated. Therapeutic approaches that target the gut microbiota (eg, dietary intervention and probiotics) against MASLD and related diseases are further explored. With better understanding of the multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms, the development of innovative therapeutics that target the root causes of MASLD and MASH is greatly facilitated. The possibility of alleviating MASH and achieving better patient outcomes is within reach. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, and it can progress to more severe pathologies, including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases has facilitated the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.

    "abstract": "To maintain their growth rate, cancer cells must secure a supply of fatty acids, which are necessary for building cell membranes and maintaining energy processes. This is one of the reasons why tissues with intensive fatty acid metabolism, such as the mammary gland, are more likely to develop tumors. One natural or induced defense process against cancer is ferroptosis, which interferes with normal fatty acid metabolism. This leads to the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which causes a rearrangement of the metabolism and damages cell membranes. As a consequence of this oxidation, there is a shortage of normal polyunsaturated fatty acids, which disturbs the complicated metabolism of fatty acids. This imbalance in metabolism, resulting from the deficiency of properly structured fatty acids, is called, by these authors, \"acyl starvation.\" When cancer cells are exposed to alternating hypoxia and reoxygenation, they often develop resistance to neoadjuvant therapies. Blocking the stearoyl-CoA desaturase - fatty acid-binding protein 4 - fatty acid translocase axis appears to be a promising pathway in the treatment of breast cancer. On the one hand, the inhibition of desaturase leads to the formation of toxic phospholipid hydroperoxides in ferroptosis, whereas on the other hand, the inhibition of fatty acid-binding protein 4 and translocase leads to a reduced uptake of fatty acids and disruption of the cellular transport of fatty acids, resulting in intracellular acyl starvation. The disruption in the metabolism of fatty acids in cancer cells may augment the effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Regulation of the metabolism of fatty acids in cancer cells seems to be a promising therapeutic direction. Studies show that the induction of ferroptosis in cancer cells, combined with use of neoadjuvant therapies, effectively inhibits the proliferation of these cells. We link the process of ferroptosis with apoptosis and SCD1-FABP4-CD36 axis and propose the term \"acyl starvation\" for the processes leading to FA deficiency, dysregulation of FA metabolism in cancer cells, and, most importantly, the appearance of incorrect proportions FAs.",

Oct4, also known as POU5F1, is a key transcription factor in the self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of stem cells. Although it has been detected in advanced gliomas, the biological function of Oct4, and transcriptional machinery maintained by the stemness of Oct4 protein-mediated glioma stem cells (GSC), has not been fully determined.\nMETHODS: The expression of Oct4 variants was evaluated in brain cancer cell lines, and in brain tumor tissues, by quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis. The palmitoylation level of Oct4A was determined by the acyl-biotin exchange method, and the effects of palmitoylation Oct4A on GSCs were investigated by a series of in vitro (neuro-sphere formation assay, double immunofluorescence, pharmacological treatment, luciferase assay, and coimmunoprecipitation) and in vivo (xenograft model) experiments.\nRESULTS: Here, we report that all three variants of Oct4 are expressed in different types of cerebral cancer, while Oct4A is important for maintaining tumorigenicity in GSCs. Palmitoylation mediated by ZDHHC17 was indispensable for preserving Oct4A from lysosome degradation to maintain its protein stability. Oct4A palmitoylation also helped to integrate Sox4 and Oct4A in the SOX2 enhancement subregion to maintain the stem performance of GSCs.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AIMS: SLC25A47 was initially identified as a mitochondrial HCC-downregulated carrier protein, but its physiological functions and transport substrates are unknown. We aimed to investigate the physiological role of SLC25A47 in hepatic metabolism.\nAPPROACH RESULTS: In the treatment of hepatocytes with metformin, we found that metformin can transcriptionally activate the expression of Slc25a47 , which is required for AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) phosphorylation. Slc25a47 -deficient mice had increased hepatic lipid content, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels, and we found that Slc25a47 deficiency suppressed AMPKα phosphorylation and led to an increased accumulation of nuclear SREBPs, with elevated fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic activities. Conversely, when Slc25a47 was overexpressed in mouse liver, AMPKα was activated and resulted in the inhibition of lipogenesis. Moreover, using a diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCC model, we found that the deletion of Slc25a47 promoted HCC tumorigenesis and development through the activated mammalian target of rapamycin cascade. Employing homology modeling of SLC25A47 and virtual screening of the human metabolome database, we demonstrated that NAD + was an endogenous substrate for SLC25A47, and the activity of NAD + -dependent sirtuin 3 declined in Slc25a47 -deficient mice, followed by inactivation of AMPKα.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that SLC25A47, a hepatocyte-specific mitochondrial NAD + transporter, is one of the pharmacological targets of metformin and regulates lipid homeostasis through AMPKα, and may serve as a potential drug target for treating NAFLD and HCC.",

Here, we identify that GBM upregulates diacylglycerol-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) to store excess FAs into triglycerides and lipid droplets. Inhibiting DGAT1 disrupted lipid homeostasis and resulted in excessive FAs moving into mitochondria for oxidation, leading to the generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Adding N-acetyl-cysteine or inhibiting FA shuttling into mitochondria decreased ROS and cell death induced by DGAT1 inhibition. We show in xenograft models that targeting DGAT1 blocked lipid droplet formation, induced tumor cell apoptosis, and markedly suppressed GBM growth. Together, our study demonstrates that DGAT1 upregulation protects GBM from oxidative damage and maintains lipid homeostasis by facilitating storage of excess FAs.

    "abstract": "Most deaths from cancer are explained by metastasis, and yet large-scale metastasis research has been impractical owing to the complexity of in vivo models. Here we introduce an in vivo barcoding strategy that is capable of determining the metastatic potential of human cancer cell lines in mouse xenografts at scale. We validated the robustness, scalability and reproducibility of the method and applied it to 500 cell lines1,2 spanning 21 types of solid tumour. We created a first-generation metastasis map (MetMap) that reveals organ-specific patterns of metastasis, enabling these patterns to be associated with clinical and genomic features. We demonstrate the utility of MetMap by investigating the molecular basis of breast cancers capable of metastasizing to the brain-a principal cause of death in patients with this type of cancer. Breast cancers capable of metastasizing to the brain showed evidence of altered lipid metabolism. Perturbation of lipid metabolism in these cells curbed brain metastasis development, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to combat the disease and demonstrating the utility of MetMap as a resource to support metastasis research.",

    "abstract": "The Warburg effect is a tumor-related phenomenon that could potentially be targeted therapeutically. Here, we showed that glioblastoma (GBM) cultures and patients' tumors harbored super-enhancers in several genes related to the Warburg effect. By conducting a transcriptome analysis followed by ChIP-Seq coupled with a comprehensive metabolite analysis in GBM models, we found that FDA-approved global (panobinostat, vorinostat) and selective (romidepsin) histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors elicited metabolic reprogramming in concert with disruption of several Warburg effect-related super-enhancers. Extracellular flux and carbon-tracing analyses revealed that HDAC inhibitors blunted glycolysis in a c-Myc-dependent manner and lowered ATP levels. This resulted in the engagement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) driven by elevated fatty acid oxidation (FAO), rendering GBM cells dependent on these pathways. Mechanistically, interference with HDAC1/-2 elicited a suppression of c-Myc protein levels and a concomitant increase in 2 transcriptional drivers of oxidative metabolism, PGC1α and PPARD, suggesting an inverse relationship. Rescue and ChIP experiments indicated that c-Myc bound to the promoter regions of PGC1α and PPARD to counteract their upregulation driven by HDAC1/-2 inhibition. Finally, we demonstrated that combination treatment with HDAC and FAO inhibitors extended animal survival in patient-derived xenograft model systems in vivo more potently than single treatments in the absence of toxicity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is a novel form of iron-dependent cell death and participates in the malignant progression of glioblastoma (GBM). Although circular RNAs (circRNAs) are found to play key roles in ferroptosis via several mechanisms, including regulating iron metabolism, glutathione metabolism, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial-related proteins, there are many novel circRNAs regulating ferroptosis need to be found, and they may become a new molecular treatment target in GBM.\nMETHODS: The expression levels of circLRFN5, PRRX2 and GCH1 were detected by qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Lentiviral-based infections were used to overexpress or knockdown these molecules in glioma stem cells (GSCs). The biological functions of these molecules on GSCs were detected by MTS (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium), the 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, transwell, neurosphere formation assays, Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) and xenograft experiments. The content of ferroptosis levels in GSCs was detected by BODIPY 581/591 C11 assay, glutathione (GSH) assay and malondialdehyde (MDA) assay. The regulating mechanisms among these molecules were studied by RNA immunoprecipitation assay, RNA pull-down assay, ubiquitination assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.\nRESULTS: We found a novel circRNA circLRFN5 is downregulated in GBM and associated with GBM patients' poor prognosis. CircLRFN5 overexpression inhibits the cell viabilities, proliferation, neurospheres formation, stemness and tumorigenesis of GSCs via inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, circLRFN5 binds to PRRX2 protein and promotes its degradation via a ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. PRRX2 can transcriptionally upregulate GCH1 expression in GSCs, which is a ferroptosis suppressor via generating the antioxidant tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study found circLRFN5 as a tumor-suppressive circRNA and identified its role in the progression of ferroptosis and GBM. CircLRFN5 can be used as a potential GBM biomarker and become a target for molecular therapies or ferroptosis-dependent therapy in GBM.",

Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis-mediated therapy could offer an appropriate alternative treatment option against cancer cells that are resistant to certain drugs.

In the present work, we report that proline rich protein 11 (PRR11) depletion significantly sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ by inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, PRR11 directly binds to and stabilizes dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which leads to glioma ferroptosis-resistant in a DHODH-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, PRR11 inhibits HERC4 and DHODH binding, by suppressing the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC4 and polyubiquitination degradation of DHODH at the K306 site, which maintains DHODH protein stability. Importantly, downregulated PRR11 increases lipid peroxidation and alters DHODH-mediated mitochondrial morphology, thereby promoting ferroptosis and increasing TMZ chemotherapy sensitivity. In conclusion, our results reveal a mechanism via which PRR11 drives ferroptosis resistance and identifies ferroptosis induction and TMZ as an attractive combined therapeutic strategy for GBM.",

We developed a syngeneic mouse teratoma model derived from noncancerous mouse embryonic stem cells and conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that impact early phases of cancer immunoediting. We found that loss of pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor genes, including Trp53, increased necrosis in teratomas, releasing APOE lipid particles into the extracellular milieu.

Increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) protects tumor cells from lipid peroxidation-induced cell death, although the precise mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we report that loss of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) in GBM critically regulated lipid peroxidation and tumorigenesis by controlling the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). TRAF3 was frequently repressed in GBM due to promoter hypermethylation. TRAF3 interacted with enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (ECH1), an enzyme that catalyzes the isomerization of unsaturated FAs (UFAs) and mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of ECH1 at Lys214. ECH1 ubiquitination impeded TOMM20-dependent mitochondrial translocation of ECH1, which otherwise promoted the oxidation of UFAs, preferentially the PUFAs, and limited lipid peroxidation. Overexpression of TRAF3 enhanced the sensitivity of GBM to ferroptosis and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) immunotherapy in mice. Thus, the TRAF3/ECH1 axis played a key role in the metabolism of PUFAs and was crucial for lipid peroxidation damage and immune elimination in GBM.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abnormal activation of FAK is associated with tumor development and metastasis. Through interactions with other intracellular signalling molecules, FAK influences cytoskeletal remodelling, modulation of adhesion signalling, and activation of transcription factors, promoting migration and invasion of tumor cells. However, the exact mechanism that regulates these processes remains unresolved. Herein, our findings indicate that the S-palmitoylation of FAK is crucial for both its membrane localization and activation.\nMETHODS: The palmitoylation of FAK in U251 and T98G cells was assessed by an acyl-PEG exchange (APE) assay and a metabolic incorporation assay. Cellular palmitoylation was inhibited using 2-bromopalmitate, and the palmitoylation status and cellular localization of FAK were determined. A metabolic incorporation assay was used to identify the potential palmitoyl acyltransferase and the palmitoylation site of FAK. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays, colony formation assays, and Transwell assays were conducted to assess the impact of ZDHHC5 in GBM. Additionally, intracranial GBM xenografts were utilized to investigate the effects of genetically silencing ZDHHC5 on tumor growth.\nRESULTS: Inhibiting FAK palmitoylation leads to its redistribution from the membrane to the cytoplasm and a decrease in its phosphorylation. Moreover, ZDHHC5, a protein-acyl-transferase (PAT), catalyzes this key modification of FAK at C456. Knockdown of ZDHHC5 abrogates the S-palmitoylation and membrane distribution of FAK and impairs cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Taken together, our research reveals the crucial role of ZDHHC5 as a PAT responsible for FAK S-palmitoylation, membrane localization, and activation.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results imply that targeting the ZDHHC5/FAK axis has the potential to be a promising strategy for therapeutic interventions for glioblastoma (GBM).

This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the molecular and genetic landscape of GBM, focusing on key oncogenic drivers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which are critical for tumorigenesis and progression. We delve into the role of epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, in driving therapy resistance and tumor evolution.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary intracranial malignant tumor. Recent literature suggests that induction of programmed death has become a mainstream cancer treatment strategy, with ferroptosis being the most widely studied mode. Complement C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) is associated with both tumorigenesis and tumor-related immunity. However, knowledge regarding the role of C5aR1 in GBM progression is limited. In the present study, we observed significant upregulation of C5aR1 in glioma tissue. In addition, C5aR1 expression was found to be closely associated with patient prognosis and survival. Subsequent experimental verification demonstrated that C5aR1 promoted the progression of GBM mainly by suppressing ferroptosis induction, inhibiting the accumulation of lipid peroxides, and stabilizing the expression of the core antiferroptotic factor glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Aberrant N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of GPX4 mRNA contributes significantly to epigenetic tumorigenesis, and here, we report that selective methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-dependent m6A methylation of GPX4 plays a key role in C5AR1 knockdown-induced ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, ERK1/2 signaling pathway activation increases the METTL3 protein abundance in GBM cells. This activation then increases the stability of METTL3-mediated m6A modifications on GPX4, enabling it to fulfill its transcriptional function. More importantly, in an intracranial xenograft mouse model, PMX205, a C5aR1 inhibitor, promoted alterations in ferroptosis in GBM cells and inhibited GBM progression. In conclusion, our findings suggest that C5aR1 inhibits ferroptosis in GBM cells and promotes MettL3-dependent GPX4 expression through ERK1/2, thereby promoting glioma progression. Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which the intracellular complement receptor C5aR1 suppresses ferroptosis induction and promotes GBM progression. These findings may facilitate the identification of a potential therapeutic target for glioma.",

Here, we comprehensively evaluated the significance of a novel immune-related GDE-circRNA in the glioma microenvironment.\nMETHODS: GDE-circPRKD3 was screened out through high-throughput sequencing and verified by RT-PCR, sanger sequencing, and RNase R assays. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to investigate the function of GDE-circPRKD3.

Overexpression of GDE-circPRKD3 significantly impairs the biological competence of glioma and prolongs the survival of xenograft mice. GDE-circPRKD3 binds to HNRNPC in an m6A-dependent manner, accelerates mRNA decay of IL6ST, and inhibits downstream target STAT3. Notably, GDE-circPRKD3 promotes CXCL10 secretion by reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages, which in turn recruits CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes against GBM. Moreover, brain-targeted lipid nanoparticle delivery of circPRKD3 combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy achieves significant combinatorial benefits.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides a novel mechanism by which GDE-circPRKD3 relies on STAT3 signaling to remodel immunosuppressive TME and offers a potential RNA immunotherapy strategy for GBM treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The consumption of sugar and a high-fat diet (HFD) promotes the development of obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Despite their well-known synergy, the mechanisms by which sugar worsens the outcomes associated with a HFD are largely elusive.\nMETHODS: Six-week-old, male, C57Bl/6 J mice were fed either chow or a HFD and were provided with regular, fructose- or glucose-sweetened water. Moreover, cultured AML12 hepatocytes were engineered to overexpress ketohexokinase-C (KHK-C) using a lentivirus vector, while CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockdown CPT1α. The cell culture experiments were complemented with in vivo studies using mice with hepatic overexpression of KHK-C and in mice with liver-specific CPT1α knockout. We used comprehensive metabolomics, electron microscopy, mitochondrial substrate phenotyping, proteomics and acetylome analysis to investigate underlying mechanisms.\nRESULTS: Fructose supplementation in mice fed normal chow and fructose or glucose supplementation in mice fed a HFD increase KHK-C, an enzyme that catalyzes the first step of fructolysis. Elevated KHK-C is associated with an increase in lipogenic proteins, such as ACLY, without affecting their mRNA expression. An increase in KHK-C also correlates with acetylation of CPT1α at K508, and lower CPT1α protein in vivo. In vitro, KHK-C overexpression lowers CPT1α and increases triglyceride accumulation. The effects of KHK-C are, in part, replicated by a knockdown of CPT1α. An increase in KHK-C correlates negatively with CPT1α protein levels in mice fed sugar and a HFD, but also in genetically obese db/db and lipodystrophic FIRKO mice. Mechanistically, overexpression of KHK-C in vitro increases global protein acetylation and decreases levels of the major cytoplasmic deacetylase, SIRT2.\nCONCLUSIONS: KHK-C-induced acetylation is a novel mechanism by which dietary fructose augments lipogenesis and decreases fatty acid oxidation to promote the development of metabolic complications.\nIMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Fructose is a highly lipogenic nutrient whose negative consequences have been largely attributed to increased de novo lipogenesis. Herein, we show that fructose upregulates ketohexokinase, which in turn modifies global protein acetylation, including acetylation of CPT1a, to decrease fatty acid oxidation. Our findings broaden the impact of dietary sugar beyond its lipogenic role and have implications on drug development aimed at reducing the harmful effects attributed to sugar metabolism.",

Here, we investigated the effect of momordicine-I (M-I), a key bioactive compound from Momordica charantia (bitter melon), on metabolic pathways in human head and neck cancer (HNC) cells and a mouse HNC tumorigenicity model. We found that M-I treatment on HNC cells significantly reduced the expression of key glycolytic molecules, SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), HK1, PFKP, PDK3, PKM, and LDHA at the mRNA and protein levels. We further observed reduced lactate accumulation, suggesting glycolysis was perturbed in M-I treated HNC cells. Metabolomic analyses confirmed a marked reduction in glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites in M-I-treated cells. M-I treatment significantly downregulated mRNA and protein expression of essential enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis, including ACLY, ACC1, FASN, SREBP1, and SCD1. Using shotgun lipidomics, we found a significant increase in lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine loss in M-I treated cells. Subsequently, we observed dysregulation of mitochondrial membrane potential and significant reduction of mitochondrial oxygen consumption after M-I treatment. We further observed M-I treatment induced autophagy, activated AMPK and inhibited mTOR and Akt signaling pathways and leading to apoptosis. However, blocking autophagy did not rescue the M-I-mediated alterations in lipogenesis, suggesting an independent mechanism of action. M-I treated mouse HNC MOC2 cell tumors displayed reduced Hk1, Pdk3, Fasn, and Acly expression. In conclusion, our study revealed that M-I inhibits glycolysis, lipid metabolism, induces autophagy in HNC cells and reduces tumor volume in mice.

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases which lacks ideal treatment options. Kaempferol and kaempferide, two natural flavonol compounds isolated from Hippophae rhamnoides L., were reported to exhibit a strong regulatory effect on lipid metabolism, for which the mechanism is largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of kaempferol and kaempferide on oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 cells, a widely used in vitro model of NAFLD. The results indicated an increased accumulation of lipid droplets and triacylglycerol (TG) by OA, which was attenuated by kaempferol and kaempferide (5, 10 and 20 μM). Western blot analysis demonstrated that kaempferol and kaempferide reduced expression of lipogenesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1). Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT enhancer binding proteins β (C/EBPβ), two adipogenic transcription factors, was also decreased by kaempferol and kaempferide treatment. In addition, western blot analysis also demonstrated that kaempferol and kaempferide reduced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear transcription factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Molecular docking was performed to identify the direct molecular targets of kaempferol and kaempferide, and their binding to SCD-1, a critical regulator in lipid metabolism, was revealed. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that kaempferol and kaempferide could attenuate OA-induced lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells, which might benefit the treatment of NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many members of the oxysterol-binding protein-related protein (ORP) family have been characterized in detail over the past decades, but the lipid transport and other functions of ORP7 still remain elusive. What is known about ORP7 points toward an endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane-localized protein, which also interacts with GABA type A receptor-associated protein like 2 (GABARAPL2) and unlipidated Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B), suggesting a further autophagosomal/lysosomal association. Functional roles of ORP7 have been suggested in cholesterol efflux, hypercholesterolemia, and macroautophagy. We performed a hypothesis-free multi-omics analysis of chemical ORP7 inhibition utilizing transcriptomics and lipidomics as well as proximity biotinylation interactomics to characterize ORP7 functions in a primary cell type, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, assays on angiogenesis, cholesterol efflux, and lipid droplet quantification were conducted.\nRESULTS: Pharmacological inhibition of ORP7 leads to an increase in gene expression related to lipid metabolism and inflammation, while genes associated with cell cycle and cell division were downregulated. Lipidomic analysis revealed increases in ceramides and lysophosphatidylcholines as well as saturated and monounsaturated triacylglycerols. Significant decreases were seen in all cholesteryl ester and in some unsaturated triacylglycerol species, compatible with the detected decrease of mean lipid droplet area. Along with the reduced lipid stores, ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1)-mediated cholesterol efflux and angiogenesis decreased. Interactomics revealed an interaction of ORP7 with AKT1, a central metabolic regulator.\nCONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomics results suggest an increase in prostanoid as well as oxysterol synthesis, which could be related to the observed upregulation of proinflammatory genes. We envision that the defective angiogenesis in HUVECs subjected to ORP7 inhibition could be the result of an unfavorable plasma membrane lipid composition and/or reduced potential for cell division. To conclude, the present study suggests multifaceted functions of ORP7 in lipid homeostasis, angiogenic tube formation, and gene expression of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cell cycle in primary endothelial cells.",

This study illustrated a novel mechanism for long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) CRCMSL in CRC, which was identified as a CRC suppressor in our previous study.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CRCMSL suppresses colorectal cancer by interfering in lipid metabolism.\nMETHODS: Potential functions of CRCMSL were predicted by GSEA, which led to lipidomics. Ferroptosis process in CRC were evaluated by protein markers, probe-reported lipid peroxidation signals and transmission electron microscopy. Order and fluidity of phospholipid bilayers were detected by Laurdan generalized polarization (GP) assays and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays, respectively. RNA pull-down and RIP assays were performed to explore the target of CRCMSL. qPCR, western blot and enzyme activity detections were used to explore the effects of CRCMSL on the target. Orthotopic and subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice were used to validate efficacy of CRC in vivo.\nRESULTS: CRCMSL-knockdown upregulated lipid synthesis and remodeled fatty acyl chains in phospholipids, inspiring studies on ferroptosis and phospholipid bilayers. CRCMSL-mediated biological processes and behaviors were restored by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a key enzyme for the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), suggesting that CRCMSL promotes ferroptosis and reduces membrane fluidity by interfering in phospholipid unsaturation. The target of CRCMSL in fatty acid metabolism is acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), a key enzyme for de novo fatty acid synthesis. CRCMSL promoted ACC1 phosphorylation to restrict its activity.

A total of 50 patients over 20 years of age diagnosed with stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer with an ECOG performance status of 0-2 who are eligible for systemic treatment will be included and randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms: four fish oil capsules containing 2,100 mg EPA and 924 mg DHA per day versus four placebo capsules containing 2,250 mg oleic acid per day for 4 months. All patients will be instructed to consume 1.5 g protein per kg body weight per day and receive protein supplementation if necessary. MM, myosteatosis, muscle function, handgrip strength, dietary assessment, toxicity, response to treatment, and survival will be assessed. Translational research includes membrane phospholipid composition, gut microbiota, inflammation, and miRNA. MicroRNA will be analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, phospholipids, by gas chromatography, and microbiota, by 16S ribosomal RNA genetic sequencing. Statistical analysis will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics V.26 and a multiple regression model will be proposed. Associations with p < 0.05 will be considered significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: The HEPRO study aims to evaluate a viable dietary intervention strategy to improve MM and function in patients with lung cancer.",

Furthermore, assessing how these FFA- mediated processes interact with genetic risk for disease remains elusive. Here we report the design and implementation of FALCON (Fatty Acid Library for Comprehensive ONtologies) as an unbiased, scalable and multimodal interrogation of 61 structurally diverse FFAs.

Furthermore, we developed a new approach to prioritize genes that reflect the combined effects of exposure to harmful FFAs and genetic risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Importantly, we found that c-MAF inducing protein (CMIP) protects cells from exposure to FFAs by modulating Akt signaling and we validated the role of CMIP in human pancreatic beta cells. In sum, FALCON empowers the study of fundamental FFA biology and offers an integrative approach to identify much needed targets for diverse diseases associated with disordered FFA metabolism.\nHIGHLIGHTS: FALCON (Fatty Acid Library for Comprehensive ONtologies) enables multimodal profiling of 61 free fatty acids (FFAs) to reveal 5 FFA clusters with distinct biological effectsFALCON is applicable to many and diverse cell typesA subset of monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) equally or more toxic than canonical lipotoxic saturated FAs (SFAs) leads to decreased membrane fluidityNew approach prioritizes genes that represent the combined effects of environmental (FFA) exposure and genetic risk for diseaseC-Maf inducing protein (CMIP) is identified as a suppressor of FFA-induced lipotoxicity via Akt-mediated signaling.",

Unlike cells enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids, cells cultured in media containing palmitic or oleic acid showed no changes in membrane fluidity or fatty acid composition.

    "abstract": "This review summarizes the cellular bases of the effects of NaCHOleate (2-hydroxyoleic acid; 2OHOA; Minerval) against glioma and other types of tumors. NaCHOleate, activates sphingomyelin synthase (SGMS) increasing the levels of cell membrane sphingomyelin (SM) and diacylglycerol (DAG) together with reductions of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). The increases in the membrane levels of NaCHOleate itself and of DAG induce a translocation and overexpression of protein kinase C (PKC) and subsequent reductions of Cyclin D, cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDKs 4 and 6), hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, inhibition of E2F1 and knockdown of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) impairing DNA synthesis. In addition in some cancer cells, the increases in SM are associated with Fas receptor (FasR) capping and ligand-free induction of apoptosis. In glioma cell lines, the increases in SM are associated with the inhibition of the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, in association with p27Kip1 overexpression. Finally, an analysis of the Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) database for glioma patient survival shows that the weight of SM-related metabolism gene expression in glioma patients' survival is similar to glioma-related genes. Due to its low toxicity and anti-tumoral effect in cell and animal models its status as an orphan drug for glioma treatment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was recently acknowledged and a phase 1/2A open label, non-randomized study was started in patients with advanced solid tumors including malignant glioma.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of live cultured cells stained with viscosity-sensitive probe BODIPY 2 was exploited to non-invasively assess viscosity in the course of treatment and adaptation to the drug. In parallel, lipid composition of membranes was examined with the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Our results showed that a single treatment with 5-FU induced only temporal changes of viscosity in 5-FU sensitive cells immediately after adding the drug. Acquisition of chemoresistance was accompanied by persistent increase of viscosity, which was preserved upon treatment without any changes. Lipidomic analysis revealed that the resistant cells had a lower level of monounsaturated fatty acids and increased sphingomyelin or decreased phosphatidylcholine in their membranes, which partly explain increase of the viscosity. Thus, we propose that a high membrane viscosity mediates the acquisition of resistance to 5-FU.",

Lipid composition influences neoplastic behaviour. Therefore, this study examined whether lipid composition affects sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in CRC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a lipidomic analysis of a CRC xenograft-derived spheroid model to identify potential relationships between the lipid profile and chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Genetic and pharmacological modulation of lipid synthesis were also used in the HCT-116 and DLD-1 CRC cell lines to further characterize resistance to 5-FU.\nRESULTS: Our lipidomic profiling revealed that phospholipids with saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were more abundant in 5-FU-resistant spheroids. The importance of phospholipids containing SFA in chemoresistance was confirmed by showing that in HCT-116 and DLD-1 cells, genetic or pharmacological inactivation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, a key enzyme that converts SFAs to monounsaturated fatty acids, increased the proportion of SFAs in membranous phospholipids and reduced cell membrane fluidity, and this ultimately resulted in resistance to 5-FU.\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that the saturated to monounsaturated fatty acid ratio in cellular membranous phospholipids affects sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "The regulatory chemical mechanisms of lipid trafficking and degradation are involved in many pathophysiological processes, being implicated in severe pain, inflammation, and cancer. In addition, the processing of lipids is also relevant for industrial and environmental applications. However, there is poor understanding of the chemical features that control lipid membrane trafficking and allow lipid-degrading enzymes to efficiently select and hydrolyze specific fatty acids from a complex cellular milieu of bioactive lipids. This is particularly true for lipid acyl chains, which have diverse structures that can critically affect the many complex reactions needed to elongate, desaturate, or transport fatty acids. Building upon our own contributions in this field, we will discuss how molecular simulations, integrated with experimental evidence, have revealed that the structure and dynamics of the lipid tail are actively involved in modulating membrane trafficking at cellular organelles, and enzymatic reactions at cell membranes. Further evidence comes from recent crystal structures of lipid receptors and remodeling enzymes. Taken together, these recent works have identified those structural features of the lipid acyl chain that are crucial for the regioselectivity and stereospecificity of essential desaturation reactions. In this context, we will first illustrate how atomistic and coarse-grained simulations have elucidated the structure-function relationships between the chemical composition of the lipid's acyl chains and the molecular properties of lipid bilayers. Particular emphasis will be given to the prominent chemical role of the number of double carbon-carbon bonds along the lipid acyl chain, that is, discriminating between saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated lipids. Different levels of saturation in fatty acid molecules dramatically influence the biophysical properties of lipid assemblies and their interaction with proteins. We will then discuss the processing of lipids by membrane-bound enzymes. Our focus will be on lipids such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. These are the main molecules that act as neurotransmitters in the endocannabinoid system. Specifically, recent findings indicate a crucial interplay between the level of saturation of the lipid tail, its energetically and sterically favored conformations, and the hydrophobic accessory cavities in lipid-degrading enzymes, which help form catalytically active conformations of the selected substrate. This Account will emphasize how the specific chemical structure of acyl chains affects the molecular mechanisms for modulating membrane trafficking and selective hydrolysis. The results examined here show that, by using molecular simulations to investigate lipid plasticity and substrate flexibility, researchers can enrich their interpretation of experimental results about the structure-function relationships of lipids. This could positively impact chemical and biological studies in the field and ultimately support protein engineering studies and structure-based drug discovery to target lipid-processing enzymes.",

    "abstract": "To investigate how the fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids influences brain-specific processes, we leveraged the AdipoR2 (adiponectin receptor 2) knockout mouse model in which the brain is enlarged, and cellular membranes are excessively rich in saturated fatty acids. Lipidomics analysis of brains at 2, 7, and 18 months of age showed that phosphatidylcholines, which make up about two-thirds of all cerebrum membrane lipids, contain a gross excess of saturated fatty acids in AdipoR2 knockout mice, and that this is mostly attributed to an excess palmitic acid (C16:0) at the expense of oleic acid (C18:1), consistent with a defect in fatty acid desaturation and elongation in the mutant. Specifically, there was a ~12% increase in the overall saturated fatty acid content within phosphatidylcholines and a ~30% increase in phosphatidylcholines containing two palmitic acids. Phosphatidylethanolamines, sphingomyelins, ceramides, lactosylceramides, and dihydroceramides also showed an excess of saturated fatty acids in the AdipoR2 knockout mice while nervonic acid (C24:1) was enriched at the expense of shorter saturated fatty acids in glyceroceramides. Similar defects were found in the cerebellum and myelin sheaths. Histology showed that cell density is lower in the cerebrum of AdipoR2 knockout mice, but electron microscopy did not detect reproducible defects in the ultrastructure of cerebrum neurons, though proteomics analysis showed an enrichment of electron transport chain proteins in the cerebellum. Behavioral tests showed that older (33 weeks old) AdipoR2 knockout mice are hyperactive and anxious compared to control mice of a similar age. Also, in contrast to control mice, the AdipoR2 knockout mice do not gain weight in old age but do have normal lifespans. We conclude that an excess fatty acid saturation in brain phospholipids is accompanied by hyperactivity but seems otherwise well tolerated.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with obesity and an increased risk for liver cirrhosis and cancer. Neutral ceramidase (NcDase), which is highly expressed in the intestinal brush border of the small intestine, plays a critical role in digesting dietary sphingolipids (ceramide) to regulate the balance of sphingosine and free fatty acids. It remains unresolved whether obesity-associated alteration of NcDase contributes to the manifestation of NASH. Here, we revealed that NcDase deficiency in murine models of NASH prevents hepatic inflammation and fibrosis but not steatosis.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: NcDase-/- mice display reduced stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) 1 expression with a compositional decrease of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) under the different dietary conditions. We further found that NcDase is a functional regulator of intestinal B cells and influences the abundance and quality of the secretory IgA response toward commensal bacteria. Analysis of composition of the gut microbiota found that Clostridiales colonization was increased in NcDase-/- mice. The colonization of germ-free mice with gut microbiota from NcDase-/- mice resulted in a greater decrease in the expression of SCD1 and the level of MUFAs in the liver relative to gut microbiota from wild-type littermates, which are associated with the alternation of IgA-bound bacteria, including increase of Ruminococcaceae and reduction of Desulfovibrio. Mechanistically, NcDase is a crucial link that controls the expression of SCD1 and MUFA-mediated activation of the Wnt/β-catenin. Very importantly, our experiments further demonstrated that Wnt3a stimulation can enhance the activity of NcDase in hepatocytes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thus, the NcDase-SCD1-Wnt feedback loop promotes the diet-induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis through the regulation of intestinal IgA+ immune cells.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The influence of nutrition on breast cancer prognosis is still inconclusive and therefore dietary interventions incorporating dietary biomarkers are needed to confirm compliance with dietary goals and clarify biological mechanisms. The present study assessed whether a lifestyle intervention in breast cancer survivors could affect dietary biomarkers of fruit and vegetables and fatty acids.\nMETHODS: In this phase II single-arm trial, 37 overweight/obese early stage breast cancer patients completed a 12-week diet and exercise intervention. The intervention involved 1-h weekly diet sessions delivered by a dietician and 75-min bi-weekly physical activity sessions of moderate-to-high intensity led by trained monitors. Before and after the intervention, three 24-h dietary recalls were carried out to calculate nutrient intakes and, in addition, blood samples were taken to measure plasma carotenoids, vitamin E and retinol concentrations and erythrocyte membrane fatty acid (EFA) composition. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to assess changes in dietary and biomarkers measurements over the intervention period.\nRESULTS: After the intervention, there was a significant increase in the intake of dietary carotenoids (+15.1% compared to baseline) but not plasma carotenoids levels (+6.3%). Regarding the EFA levels, we observed a significant decrease in percentage of saturated fatty acids (-1.4%) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (-2.9%) and an increase in monounsaturated fatty acids (1.7%) and total and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (by 13.1% and 13.7%, respectively). A favourable decrease in the ratio of long-chain n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (-9.1%) was also observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: After a short-term diet and exercise intervention in overweight/obese breast cancer survivors, we observed significant changes in dietary nutrients and fatty acid biomarkers, suggesting positive dietary changes that could be relevant for breast cancer prognosis.",

As a hydrophobic molecule located mainly in membranes it contributes together with other lipids to the physical and structural characteristics such as membrane stability, curvature, fluidity, and the organization into microdomains (lipid rafts). By acting as the main lipid-soluble antioxidant, it protects other lipids such as mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA, respectively) against chemical reactions with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) and prevents membrane destabilization and cellular dysfunction. In cells, vitamin E affects signaling in redox-dependent and redox-independent molecular mechanisms by influencing the activity of enzymes and receptors involved in modulating specific signal transduction and gene expression pathways. By protecting and preventing depletion of MUFA and PUFA it indirectly enables regulatory effects that are mediated by the numerous lipid mediators derived from these lipids. In recent years, some vitamin E metabolites have been observed to affect signal transduction and gene expression and their relevance for the regulatory function of vitamin E is beginning to be elucidated. In particular, the modulation of the CD36/FAT scavenger receptor/fatty acids transporter by vitamin E may influence many cellular signaling pathways relevant for lipid homeostasis, inflammation, survival/apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration, and senescence. Thus, vitamin E has an important role in modulating signal transduction and gene expression pathways relevant for its uptake, distribution, metabolism, and molecular action that when impaired affect physiological and patho-physiological cellular functions relevant for the prevention of a number of diseases. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 71(4):456-478, 2019.",

Colon samples were analyzed for histological parameters.\nRESULTS: Acorn-fed ham diet induced changes in gut microbiota composition, with pronounced enrichments in anti-inflammatory bacterial genera (Alistipes, Blautia, Dorea, Parabacteroides). The animals with this diet showed a strong reduction in most parameters associated to ulcerative colitis: disease activity index, macroscopic score of colitis, epitelium alteration in colon mucosa, inflammatory cell density in colon, myeloperoxidase titers in colon, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17, IFN-γ).

Biomarkers are a promising means to explore the associations between exogenous intake or endogenous production of FAs and cancer risk.\nAIM: To estimate the relationship between fatty acid content in erythrocyte membranes and HCC risk in cirrhotic patients METHODS: The \"CiRCE\" case-control study recruited cirrhotic patients from six French hospitals between 2008 and 2012. Cases were cirrhotic patients with HCC (n = 349); controls were cirrhotic patients without HCC at inclusion (n = 550). FA composition of phospholipids in erythrocyte membranes was determined by high performance gas chromatography. Odds ratios for HCC risk according to FA concentrations were estimated with multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: HCC patients were older and more often men (P < 0.001). In both groups, saturated FAs represented more than 39% of all FAs in erythrocyte membranes, mono-unsaturated FAs around 14%, and polyunsaturated FAs around 46%. High levels of C15:0 + C17:0, C20:1 n-9, C18:2 n-6 and C20:2 n-6 were associated with higher risk of HCC. The levels of C18:0 and C20:4 n-6 were lower in HCC cases than in controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: The FA composition of erythrocyte membranes differed according to the presence of HCC with higher levels of saturated FAs, linoleic and eicosadienoic acids, and lower levels of stearic and arachidonic acids. These alterations may reflect particular dietary patterns and/or altered FA metabolism. Further investigations are warranted.",

Pharmacophagous plants are rich in bioactive compounds that constitute a safe drug library for antimicrobial agents.

The results have revealed that the antibacterial rate of the MPE was 63.64%, targeting 22 species of common pathogenic bacteria. The MPE was further purified by high performance liquid chromatography (Prep-HPLC), and three different constituents (Fractions 1-3) were obtained. Of these, the Fraction 2 treatment significantly increased the cell membrane fluidity and permeability, reduced the cell surface hydrophobicity, and damaged the integrity of the cell structure, leading to the leakage of cellular macromolecules of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens (p < 0.05). Eighty-nine compounds in Fraction 2 were identified by ultra HPLC-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis, among which 4-hydroxyphenylacetylglutamic acid accounted for the highest 30.89%, followed by lubiprostone (11.86%), miltirone (10.68%), and oleic acid (10.58%). Comparative transcriptomics analysis revealed significantly altered metabolic pathways in the representative pathogens treated by Fraction 2 (p < 0.05), indicating multiple antibacterial modes.

    "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a highly aggressive disease often developing resistance to current therapies, necessitating new treatment strategies. Our study identifies SGK1, a key effector in the PI3K pathway, as a promising therapeutic target to exploit ferroptosis, a distinct form of cell death induced by iron overload and lipid peroxidation. Importantly, SGK1 activation, whether through high expression or the constitutively active SGK1-S422D mutation, confers resistance to ferroptosis in HGSOC. Conversely, SGK1 inhibition significantly enhances sensitivity to ferroptosis, as shown by increased PTGS2 expression (a ferroptosis marker), lipid peroxidation, and toxic-free iron levels. Remarkably, this enhanced cytotoxicity is reversed by ferrostatin-1 and the iron chelator deferoxamine, highlighting the pivotal roles of lipid peroxidation and iron dysregulation in the process. Mechanistically, SGK1 protects HGSOC cells from ferroptosis via NRF2-dependent pathways, promoting glutathione synthesis and iron homeostasis, and NRF2-independent pathways via mTOR/SREBP1/SCD1-mediated lipogenesis. Notably, pharmacological SGK1 inhibition sensitizes HGSOC xenograft models to ferroptosis induction, highlighting its therapeutic potential. These findings establish SGK1 as a critical regulator of ferroptosis and suggest targeting SGK1 alongside ferroptosis pathways as a potential therapeutic strategy for HGSOC patients.",
